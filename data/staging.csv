Under his leadership, the organization completed an extensive review of its operations and clinical programs, resulting in an expansive 3-year strategy to grow and diversify the company's core business. Along with a 5-year vision to drive the transformation of the healthcare experience across the continuum of its members, partners, and communities, the company has placed a renewed and intentional focus on fostering a mission-based culture, which drives every decision the company makes. The organization employs over 5,600 full-time employees in Maryland, Northern Virginia, the District of Columbia, and West Virginia.

We rely on the rich diversity of our employees' experiences and backgrounds to achieve our mission. Every year we host a Week of Equity and Action where we deepen our investment and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. During this week thousands of employees engage in workshops and volunteerism with the goal of bettering themselves and our community. 

Women make up around 70% of CareFirst's employee population, and over 50% identify as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color).
 We have 9 resource groups that connect employees over shared identities (LGBTQ, veteran status, race, etc.) and passions (climate change, healthy living, leadership development).
 Employees are encouraged to give back and volunteer in their communities with their civic engagement hours.

 As a not-for-profit, CareFirst regularly ranks among the most philanthropic organizations with $65 million invested in the community in 2020 to improve overall health, and increase the accessibility, affordability, safety, and quality of healthcare throughout its market area. The company's employees consistently add to this impact by devoting thousands of volunteer hours to numerous community organizations and social causes. The company's continued efforts to reinvest in community health care programs has repeatedly earned CareFirst regional accolades as a leading corporate philanthropist, including the No. 2 and No. 7 spots on the Baltimore Business Journal and Washington Business Journal's 2019 list of top corporate givers, respectively.

Einsame Inseln sind aus deiner Sicht ein tolles Ferienziel, haben in einer modernen Datenarchitektur jedoch nichts mehr verloren? Du bist nicht Robinson Crusoe, sondern unser nächster Toni Stark? Dann bist du bei uns genau richtig – als Team können wir mit dir die Datenwelt erobern.
Als innovatives Schweizer Software-Unternehmen realisieren wir betriebswirtschaftliche Software-Lösungen mit Abacus Business Software, der Business Intelligence-Software Qlik sowie PROVIS für namhafte Schweizer Unternehmen.

Unsere Kompetenzen liegen auf den Gebieten Konzeption, Implementierung und Einführung sowie Betreuung und Weiterentwicklung von betriebswirtschaftlichen Lösungen mit Business Software – von der Beratung bis zur Umsetzung auf hohem Niveau.
Aufgaben
Das macht deinen Alltag spannend: 

Als Data Engineer übernimmst du die Verantwortung für Schnittstellenprojekte und komplexe Datentransformationen und erleichterst unseren Kunden den Arbeitsalltag durch optimal vernetzte Systeme.
Du siehst dich selbst als Pionier und übernimmst gerne den Lead - Dank dieser Persönlichkeit erarbeitest du mit unseren Kunden, externen Partnern und internen Ansprechpersonen neue Konzepte für automatisierte und optimierte Prozesse.
Mit deinen Projektleitungsskills begleitest du deine Ansprechpersonen durch den Alltag und denkst dich immer wieder in neue Prozesse ein.
Und in deinem Alltag bist du nicht alleine: Als Teil des Business Intelligence Teams bist du mitten im Geschehen. Teamspirit wird bei uns gross geschrieben.
Die Implementation der konzipierten Lösung beim Kunden machen dein Arbeitsgebiet spannend und abwechslungsreich.
Du wirst dich immer wieder in neuen Situationen und Herausforderungen wiederfinden, was dich anspornt, deinen Erfahrungsschatz stetig zu erweitern.
Auch nach der sorgfältigen und persönlichen Einführung kannst du auf die kollegiale Unterstützung deiner Kolleginnen und Kollegen zählen.

Qualifikation
Das bringst du mit: 

Spass und Motivation – wir erwarten von dir noch keine Überfliegerqualitäten. Du solltest aber den Mut aufbringen können, dich kämpferisch und auch selbständig durch neue Situationen zu bringen. Wichtig ist auch, dass du ein gutes Verständnis an betriebswirtschaftlichen Zusammenhängen und Datenstrukturen mitbringst, damit du den Kunden und sein Business verstehst.
Weiter wünschen wir uns von dir ein ausgeprägtes analytisches Denken und Begeisterung für Datenstrukturen.
Was wir uns in deinem Bildungsrucksack vorstellen? Gar nicht so einfach, viele Wege führen zu uns. Erfolgversprechend sind sicher eine technische oder kaufmännische Ausbildung ergänzt mit einer abgeschlossenen Weiterbildung im Bereich Wirtschaftsinformatik oder Informatik.

Deine SQL-Kenntnisse hast du einsatzbereit und vorteilsweise kannst du dich noch mit weiteren Programmierkenntnissen um die Ohren schlagen.

Benefits
Und das hast du dann davon: 

Einen anspruchsvollen, aber superspannenden Job, in den wir dich vor Ort gut einarbeiten. Und wenn du sattelfest bist, gute Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten.
Es ist uns ein wenig peinlich, uns für den vermutlich besten Teamspirit weit und breit selber zu rühmen. Darum zitieren wir hier einfach ein fünf Sterne-Feedback von Kununu:

«Teamspirit wird gross geschrieben». Stimmt!

Von null auf hundert in 15… nein, nicht Sekunden, Jahren. Wir sind schnell, aber gesund gewachsen und gut organisiert. Doch etwas ist noch wie in unseren Anfängen: Die Strukturen sind schlank und du findest die richtigen Ansprechpartner leicht.
In unserem Bereich gehören wir zu den grösseren Playern und sind bekannt für unsere hohe Qualität. Kein Wunder, werden wir immer wieder als herausragend guter Umsetzungspartner ausgezeichnet.
Einen guten Lohn, den du mit deiner Leistung mitbestimmen kannst. Krankentaggeld- und Unfallversicherung? Übernehmen wir. Zusammen mit anderen Benefits macht das schnell einmal ein paar Tausender im Jahr aus.

Wir hätten noch viel mehr zu erzählen. Was Deinen Job bei uns sonst noch spannend macht zum Beispiel. Wer wir sind und wie wir so ticken. Deshalb zögere nicht und mach Dir Dein eigenes Bild.
Schon Feuer gefangen?Du willst lieber schon heute als morgen loslegen? Dann her mit deinem CV oder dem Link auf dein LinkedIn-Profil. Das Motivationsschreiben kannst du dir sparen, wir sind auch da völlig unkompliziert.
Und das (a) im Stellentitel?
Es ist unser Statement für Vielfalt. Wir stehen auf durchmischte Teams. Alter, Herkunft, Hautfarbe oder Geschlecht sind uns egal. Bei uns sind (a)lle willkommen, die uns mit ihrem Talent weiterbringen.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   From the cozy local wine store to the trendy sneaker pop-up, the Retail team at Square is equipping retail sellers with simple solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are.

 Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning; discerning where simple analytics solutions (e.g. a quick heuristic or visualization) are preferable to complex solutions (e.g. machine learning)
 Contribute to the data strategy of product engineering, influencing engineers to make well-informed architecture and design decisions that affect data at Square
 Provide comprehensive day-to-day analytics support to partner teams, developing tools and resources to empower data access and self-service so your advanced expertise can be leveraged where it is most impactful
 Lead and mentor others on medium and long-term cross-functional initiatives that span product domains




  Qualifications
   You have:

 5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent
 Fluency in SQL, with experience exploring and understanding large, complex datasets & data systems
 Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers
 Experience with statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
 Very strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
 Proven ability to lead cross-functional projects that depend on the contributions of others in a variety of disciplines
 Experience maintaining a backlog and performing independently
 Experience with a BI tool such as Looker or Tableau


 Even better:

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

 Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to build relationships and influence across the organization
 Proven ability to facilitate cross-functional projects that depend on the contributions of others in a variety of disciplines
 Fluency with data warehouse design practices, analytics, and visualization technologies (we use SQL, Looker, and Python)

Our goal is to unveil the complex mechanisms of cancer, in order to support precision oncology. Through our three divisions, IndivuServ, IndivuType, and IndivuTest, we offer specialized products and services that support our customers in biomarker and target discovery, drug development, clinical trials, individualized therapy, and more. With more than 200 employees across Europe, North America, and Asia, we are an internationally minded, future-oriented company with an ambitious growth strategy and a strong international reputation. You will work with an innovative team of leading laboratory and bioinformatics scientists, product managers, and clinicians. Become part of our community, united by the goal of curing cancer.

In the Advanced Analytics and AI group within the IndivuType division you will have access to a truly unique patient derived tissue-based oncology data resource and state-of-the-art technology to perform project-based analyses. Our multi-omics database in combination with our powerful nRavel® analytics platform drives cutting-edge precision medicine approaches to tackle cancer using a broad array of systematic molecular measurements including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data reflecting the individual molecular landscape of each patient.

We have several positions currently open in our group with the following focuses:
1) The maintenance and development of our technology stack (pipelines, databases, and AWS infrastructure) that is the foundation of the IndiuvType multi-omics resources.
2) The maintenance and development of analytical workflows and associated technologies used in interactions with our clinical and academic partners

Moreover, you will work on analytical projects distributed across the oncology-informatics spectrum, from database driven approaches, to statistical analyses, working closely together with clinical data and software development teams. Furthermore, this position gives the opportunity to not only analyze various “omics” datasets in isolation, but to develop methods on how to integrate these molecular data types to generate a more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology across large patient cohorts.

Your Responsibilities


Development and validation of bioinformatics workflows for webapps.
Undertaking analysis, documentation, and presentation of analytical projects, either for internal projects, customers or the clinical network.
Initiate and develop integrative clinically relevant multi-omics approaches on the IndivuType database.
Aid quality control of clinical and omics data within the database.
Export and process standardized datasets from (inhouse) clinical and multi-omics databases

Our Requirements


University degree in bioinformatics, biomathematics, biological sciences or similar.
Extensive experience in computational analysis of large-scale biological datasets including but not limited to mass-spec based proteomics, transcriptomics (RNA-Seq and small-RNA-Seq) and whole genome / exome sequencing.
Experience in combining multiple distinct -omics technologies, as well implementing machine learning methods on biological datasets, is a plus.
Excellent knowledge of programming languages and software environments common to bioinformatics (Python, R) as well as with Unix based operating systems.
Knowledge of databases an advantage (MySQL, Oracle, AWS Redshift).
Familiarity with tools such as github / bitbucket and Docker.

  Company Description
   Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.  There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



  Job Description
   From the cozy local wine store to the trendy sneaker pop-up, the Retail team at Square is equipping retail sellers with simple solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are.

 You will:

 Partner with the product, design, and marketing stakeholders to identify, prioritize, and answer the most important questions where analytics can have a material impact
 Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning; discerning where simple analytics solutions (e.g. a quick heuristic or visualization) are preferable to complex solutions (e.g. machine learning)
 Contribute to the data strategy of product engineering, influencing engineers to make well-informed architecture and design decisions that affect data at Square
 Provide comprehensive day-to-day analytics support to partner teams, developing tools and resources to empower data access and self-service so your advanced expertise can be leveraged where it is most impactful




  Qualifications
   You have:

 2+ years of analytics experience
 Fluency in SQL, with experience exploring and understanding large, complex datasets & data systems
 Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers
 Experience with statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, clustering user archetypes, or predicting churn
 Very strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
 Experience maintaining a backlog and performing independently


 Even better:

 Experience with a BI tool such as Looker or Tableau
 Experience with data warehouse design, development and best practices
 A degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field


 Technologies we use and teach:

 SQL (Snowflake)
 Optimizely
 Airflow (ETL)
 Looker, Amplitude, Tableau
 Python (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every day. The special object you’ve been searching for, or a new and unexpected interest you never thought you’d have: the more you look, the more you’ll find. And at Catawiki, there’s always more to the story. Every day sellers submit thousands of objects to sell on Catawiki. Our 240+ in-house experts review and select only the best to auction.

Our mission is to connect passionate enthusiasts with the objects that tell their stories. As Europe’s fastest growing online auction platform, we help over 10 million people discover new treasures every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 and have since grown to over 750 Catawikians, working across 7 international offices, while maintaining our start-up mentality every step of the way. In December 2020 we received a new €150m investment round led by Permira and are excited to be growing our team and business further across the world.

Catawiki’s purpose is to enable people to discover and obtain special objects that help them fulfill their passions. In doing so, we add some color & make the world a more interesting place.

Our Data Story

With ten-thousands of active items on auction every day, hundred-thousands of bids, millions of users, and billions of events, the Catawiki platform generates vast amounts of data. We collect this data centrally, using it to generate business insights, as well as powering machine learning models that enhance our user experience, optimize our workflows, and keep our platform safe. We believe in creating flexible models that can be applied to a variety of use cases, and in experimentation and iteration to hit the ground running and continually improve the tools we build.

The Data Team, which covers the full data spectrum of Machine Learning, Analysis and Data Engineering, has a clear a mission within Catawiki:

Why: We believe that by using data in a smart way, we can build the best Catawiki possible. We want to have impact and see opportunities everywhere.

How: We are builders, thinkers and talkers. We collaborate closely with every department to create value for our customers. We think big and hold ourselves to high standards, because our work really matters for the future of the company.

What: As a result we create business value by delivering scalable, robust models and actionable insights and predictions. We help the company to find opportunities and understand success, and we empower everyone to use data to be successful.

So what's the job

As a Senior Machine Learning Data Scientist in the Data Team at Catawiki you will focus on delivering scalable and impactful data products. You’ll work closely with our product and development teams while implementing your work. This includes:


Building production-ready models that apply machine learning and advanced data science techniques within our product offering by writing robust and scalable code.
Finding data science opportunities by exploring our extensive mobile and web data, and applying machine learning and advanced statistics to tackle these real-world business problems.
Being pragmatic when needed but also able to go deep into a problem, applying your expert knowledge of machine learning techniques
Working with cross-disciplinary teams involving product owners, developers, UX designers, and business analysts in identifying improvements and new use cases for ML
Deploy scalable models on cloud infrastructure, producing real-tome, asynchronous, and batch predictions

A little about you

You...


Are an experienced (5+ years), all-around data scientist who is as comfortable diving into the internals of a model implementation as discussing new opportunities for ML with product stakeholders
Maintain awareness of the state of the art and are familiar with a range of different ML techniques, and can select an appropriate algorithm, tool or technique for any given problem.
Give guidance and unblock others in your team by supporting them with advice and new techniques.

Are fluent in Python, capable with SQL, and you have deployed ML models serving real time responses on a large scale.
Have demonstrable experience in building robust data products that created value for the company you worked for.

The following are a plus:

Experience with one or more of the following: PyTorch/Tensorflow, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Google BigQuery, Spark, Airflow.
An entrepreneurial mindset that enables you to get things done, even if that requires actions outside your own area or comfort zone.

Here’s what we can offer you

This is your chance to become part of a fast but sustainable growing tech company! You will have an exciting role in a young, fast-growing, dynamic & international organisation. You'll be part of an enthusiastic, highly motivated team of 500+ international Catawikians; you'll have big responsibilities and can really create something. Additionally you can expect:


Working with a top notch team acting on a champions league level in a super complex dynamic environment; you will learn a lot!
A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.
A great office located in the heart of Amsterdam with an easy-going atmosphere.
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You’ll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.

Stock Options: All Catawikians are granted 100 Stock Options after 12 months of service.

And there’s more! Paid holidays, holiday allowance and a fantastic pension plan paid for by Catawiki.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you’ve got a story to tell, come and join us.

Working and hiring remotely

When it is safe to do so, Catawiki will implement a hybrid work policy where employees in the Netherlands will work from the office 1-2 times per week and from home for the rest.
