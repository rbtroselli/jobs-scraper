 If you need a change to be made so that you can make your application, you should: 
       
 Contact Government Recruitment Service via cabinetofficerecruitment.grs@cabinetoffice.gov.uk as soon as possible before the closing date to discuss your needs.

 Summary

       At HMRC we are committed to creating a great place to work for all our colleagues; an inclusive and respectful environment that reflects the diversity of the society we serve. 
      
 We want to maximise the potential of everyone who chooses to work for us and we offer a range of flexible working patterns and support to make a fulfilling career at HMRC accessible to you. 
      
 Diverse perspectives and experiences are critical to our success and we welcome applications from all people from all backgrounds with the experience and skills needed to perform this role.

HMRC transformation

 HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from. 
       
 HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 13 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities. 
       
 These offices will be located in central locations in the following towns and cities close to accessible transport links: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Croydon and Stratford. 
       
 In addition, there will also be a small number of specialist sites where the work cannot be done anywhere else, in Gartcosh (near Glasgow), Telford, Ipswich, Worthing and Dover, as well as our headquarters in central London. What’s more, our Welsh language service has people located in Porthmadog, as well as Cardiff. 
       
 We are letting you know about our future plans because if you are recruited into an office that is not one of these locations, you will be expected, subject to HM Revenue and Customs applicable policies, to move to one of these locations in the future. In some cases, this will be via one of our nine transitional sites. 
       
 For more information please contact the vacancy holder. 
       

Terms and Conditions

 We really hope you decide to apply for this role. If you’re successful you need to know that in February 2021 members of recognised trade unions (ARC and PCS) voted to approve a pay and contract reform offer. This means that HMRC will adopt new terms and conditions for all colleagues as part of a multi-year pay deal and contract offer, the pay deal period is 01 June 2020 – 31st May 2023 and terms and conditions changes take place from the 01 June 2021 onwards. These terms will apply to colleagues who already work in HMRC and if you join us, it will apply to you too. We’ve put together a summary of the key changes that will be made and you can find this attached to the Job Advert.

Position: Data Scientist - AI Start Up (East Coast -Remote)
   
 AI-powered systems are increasingly being used to replace or augment human decision-making across a broad range of industries. These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders.
   


    This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing.
   

AI Start-Up (East Coast)


    We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team. As a key member of the Data Science team, you will work alongside other data scientists, software engineers, and product owners to research, design, and develop new features that support the development of trustworthy AI for our customers. In this role, you will be required to read and contribute to cutting-edge developments in adversarial machine learning, ML bias and fairness, model staleness, and many other fascinating areas of research. You will read the latest papers and distill their core concept into product features and product direction.
   


 Duties and Responsibilities:


 Actively extend and improve our core software libraries by writing and reviewing code
 Work closely with the engineering team to integrate new features into existing products
 Contribute to the research, development, and technical design of new product features
 Develop novel tests around the security, reliability, and robustness of ML models
 Stay on top of current academic research related to ongoing team projects


 Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:


 Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative field (statistics, economics, computer science, etc.)
 Familiarity with software development practices and tools (code review, Git, etc.)
 Comfortable with multiple scientific computing libraries (pandas, sklearn, numpy, scipy)
 Familiarity with at least one deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras)
 Python programming experience (open source or product-oriented professional setting)
 Practical experience with multiple supervised ML tasks
 Excellent interpersonal and communication skills


 Preferred Qualifications:


 Deep experience in at least one area leveraging tabular data (e.g. causal inference, missing data imputation, time series analysis, bayesian statistics, etc.) demonstrated via a publication, thesis (MS or PhD), or public project (code and/or write up).
 Practical experience with model lifecycle: development, deployment, and monitoring.
 Advanced degree in a quantitative field or relevant professional experience.


 Why join us:


 To start with: we at CalypsoAI are building the first-ever security for AI solution!
 If that's not enough: We are a fast-growing startup meaning we have great opportunities to grow within the company!
 Endless opportunities to learn from our inspirational, talented team members
 You will never be bored at work again if you join us!

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), physician-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar) and technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.

We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare. We launched Pearl Health to help PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. This solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population and democratize access to healthcare risk, making it more readily available and optimized through an intelligent marketplace. We free physicians to better allocate their time with patients, increase their autonomy, and provide incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence.

What we hope you can do...

We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propeling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to more efficiently provide better care to our members and to create novel financial arrangements for each of our aligned physicians. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, comfortable working with actuaries on complicated risk analyses, and performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently. We anticipate that AI, ML, and NLP will be central elements of our product, so you should have a deep familiarity with and passion for these technologies.

What a Data Scientist means to us...
Translate the company's goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach
Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning, natural language processing, and explicable AI - likely in partnership with key external partners.
Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams to nimbly make data-driven decisions, balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.
Partner effectively with our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who you are…
3-5 years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.
Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages. Python is our current primary language and is preferred.
Experience manipulating messy and inconsistent data sets, performing statistical analyses, and presenting insights in an easily-accessible and timely fashion.
A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in AI, ML and NLP domains.
Experience collaborating with data engineering teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline and familiarity with the most common ETL tools.
Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.
Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential
The First 90 Days….

We aren't the over-prescriptive types but to give you a sense of what we think we'll do in your first 3 months together:

First 30 Days: Get your hands dirty really understanding the universe of doctors we will be partnering with in our first year in the Direct Contracting model. Help us profile risk, identify opportunities for performance improvement, and lay the foundation for the work we will do in the year ahead. Take a crash course in the still new DCE model to ensure Pearl's continued leadership in understanding and explaining its value.

First 60 Days: Navigate the crucial launch window for the 2022 Performance Year where we will receive our first batch of data from our DCE partners and begin providing our service to our doctors. Become a subject matter expert on our datasets and define the measures we will use to guide our work throughout the performance year.

First 90 Days: Own the ongoing performance analysis and improvement process as we do both bespoke work with our practices and productize insights into the platform. Dig deep on the opportunities for growth within our existing universe of doctors and potential acquisitions for Performance Year 2.

Location 
Due to Covid-19 we’ve learned that our experience virtually is possible without losing The Swarm spirit.
Remote work is a new possible way that allows flexibility and more time for everyone’s personal life, maintaining performances and company culture. We strongly believe remote work is a good practice for our team and for everyone’s daily routine, but from the other side we think we need a place for who prefers having a reason to get dressed each morning and running into their colleagues for a coffee break.
Our office in Bologna (Italy) is a cool space reserved for The Swarm in The City Center, but Remote worldwide is welcome with preference for CET-compatible time zones.

Your focus will be to participate in the research on new algorithms and methods to address topics that are both pain and gain for Stuart’s Business and Operations’ teams such as:
   


 Demand & supply forecast: how many packages need to be delivered at any time and zone? and how many drivers are available at that time and zone?
Incentive optimization: how can we move the driver to high-demand zones while staying profitable?
Real-time fraud detection & prevention: how can we detect drivers rigging the system & call them out while doing so?
Ride acceptance prediction: how likely is it that a driver is in for the ride?
Driver lifetime value: how long and regularly will a driver work for us?
Client churn: do our clients still love us?
And plenty more ...

Location: Twinkl HQ, Sheffield (remote working optional)
 Annual Salary: £25,000 - £29,000 Contract: Permanent  Line Manager: George Mulroy  Recruiter: Rikki Spencer-Cox
As a new member of the Twinkl data team you’ll be joining our established analytics network of 15+ data scientists and data analysts during an exciting period of growth (10 additional hires planned!). Working closely with the Head of Data and other experienced data scientists, you will be at the forefront of how analytics is used at Twinkl; tasked with ensuring that we derive the maximum value possible from our rich and varied datasets (over 10 trillion data points at the last count!).
Dependant on your interests and experience, you will work in one or more of the following data scientist teams: 

The Key Algorithms team: ensuring that every one of our key customer-facing algorithms (recommendations, internal search, etc) is providing the best possible website experience for every one of our customers.
The Key Subscription Metrics team: making sure that our product helps as many customers as possible by maximising subscription uptake measures such as activation, retention, upgrade and winback rate.
The Data Reporting Team: finding new ways to take data reporting to the next level and facilitate the entire business to make data-driven decisions.
The Projects team: prioritising high value data-driven projects on an ad-hoc basis to ensure that our data assets are continuously being leveraged to add the highest level of value to the organisation.

In the data team how you achieve your task is 100% over to you: no one is going to be prescribing exactly what to do, or exactly how to do it (although you’ll have a strong network of experienced Data Scientists to help you out!). To be successful you’ll need to innovate, chat with key stakeholders, and read up on best practices in order to identify and implement the most appropriate data-led solution (see ‘ongoing projects’ below to see the exciting projects the current team are working on!)
You will find the data team regularly using SQL, Python, GA, Elasticsearch and BigQuery; as well as Jira and GSheets for project management. Depending on the challenge at hand, we also use Tableau for in-depth visualisations, and big data technologies to implement machine learning solutions that Python can’t handle. Don’t worry if you’ve not used all these techs before - we’re not necessarily looking for someone with lots of experience with these languages specifically, it’s an insatiable curiosity and innate ability to think logically that we’re most interested in.
 Ongoing projects:

Leveraging our recommendation systems to preempt customer need and email them the teaching resources they need for the coming week, before they know they need them.
Continuous collaboration with the conversion rate optimisation team to test and improve all touchpoints of the user experience in a data led progression.
Blending traditional search engine logic (think TF-IDF) with cutting edge machine techniques in order to provide the best possible search experience.
Using a hybrid collaborative-filtering approach to show the most relevant resource page recommendations on each of our 500 000 resource pages.
Engineering data pipelines that analyse customer need in real-time to automatically flag (and address!) gaps in our product offering as soon as they arise.
Visit our Data Science Blog to find out more 

To succeed in the role, you will:

Have a strong analytical mindset and relentless attention to detail.
Have the ability to see projects through from conception to delivery, bringing actionable insight to bear.
Have the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts that can be actioned step by step.
Have excellent communication skills, including being able to explain complicated concepts in layman’s terms.
Be able to identify viable business opportunities that can be actioned using data.

In this role, you will have the opportunity to:

 Compose complex queries; pulling the information you need from our huge data sets (the biggest of which has more than a trillion data points!)
Implement machine learning techniques using a flexible variety of tooling and programming languages.
Work closely with senior leaders, experienced data scientists and a range of others across all levels of the organisation; partnering with them to deliver concrete results on a data led project. 
Attend in-house bi weekly training sessions, covering a range of key technical and soft skills
Apply for one of our fully funded spaces on the part-time Developer Academy Data Science course (usually costs £5000)

You’ll work with:

George Mulroy (Head of Data) - George started his career as an infant school teacher before retraining as a Data Scientist (Sheffield Uni Data Science MSc). George now works as Twinkl’s Head of Data, as well as doing occasional contract Data Science Consultancy work.

Au sein d'une équipe dédiée aux développements de solutions logicielles innovantes dans le secteur de la vente de spiritueux, votre première mission consistera à imaginer un protocole de benchmark de prix basé sur des ressources d'informations publiques. Afin d'améliorer le positionnement-prix de l'ensemble des gammes et produits, vous créerez un outil permettant la mise en place d'une mini-marketplace.
Contrairement au secteur de l'édition où un identifiant unique et très répandu (comme l'ISBN) existe, l'information sur les vins et spiritueux, tels que l'EAN, l'UDC ou le GTIN, ne sont pas systématiquement présents ni universellement reconnus sur l'intégralité des sites d'e-commerce. Afin de pallier cette limite technique et informationnelle, l'objectif sera d'utiliser des techniques à la frontière entre le traitement automatique des langues (NLP), l'image processing et le machine learning, voire le Deep Learning, afin de collecter de manière automatique sur internet les informations pertinentes concernant l'état du marché de la vente des vins et spiritueux.
Pour ce faire, il conviendra de créer un corpus et/ou un dictionnaire adapté à la recherche de mots-clés, et surtout de leur combinaison ordonnée, mais également la mise en place d'un processus automatisable de mise à jour de ce corpus et de son enrichissement régulier avec l'ensemble des données disponibles publiquement (internet, ou autre catalogue public à disposition).
Le but, in fine, étant d'identifier de manière unique l'ensemble des produits commercialisés et d'établir un processus d'appariement prix-nom précis, effectif et aisé à mettre à jour.
Diplôme d'école d'ingénieur ou universitaire, en lettres et applications quantitatives, sociologie appliquée, mathématiques appliquées, ou équivalents.
Expérience significative (5 ans et plus) dans le domaine de la Data Science. - Expérience dans le domaine de la recherche (Master Recherche / Phd.) appréciable.
Profil recherché : - Autonome - Curieux et pro-actif - Agile intellectuellement - Appétence pour le travail en équipe
Connaissances souhaitées : - Techniques d'apprentissage automatique et statistique - Expertise en NLP et Image Processing - Connaissances des modèles de Machine Learning basiques (régression linéaire et logistique, arbre de décision, SVM, plus proches voisins, k-means, etc.) - Maîtrise de Python et des librairies pertinentes (Beautifulsoup, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Scikit-Image, OpenCV, Mahotas) - Appétence pour développement et l'intégration informatique -
