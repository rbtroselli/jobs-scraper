Working at Atlassian



 Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.



 Atlassian is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Go-To Market Data Engineering (GTM-DE) team which is responsible for building our data lake, maintaining our big data pipelines / services and facilitating the movement of billions of messages each day. We work directly with the business stakeholders and plenty of platform and engineering teams to enable growth and retention strategies at Atlassian. We are looking for an open-minded, structured thinker who is passionate about building services that scale.
   


 On a typical day you will help our stakeholder teams ingest data faster into our data lake, you’ll find ways to make our data pipelines more efficient, or even come up ideas to help instigate self-serve data engineering within the company. Then you will move on to building micro-services, architecting, designing, and enabling self serve capabilities at scale to help Atlassian grow.
    




    You’ll get the opportunity to work on a AWS based data lake backed by the full suite of open source projects such as Spark and Airflow. We are a team with little legacy in our tech stack and as a result you’ll spend less time paying off technical debt and more time identifying ways to make our platform better and improve our users experience.
   


 More about you:
    




    As a data engineer in the GTM-DE team, you will have the opportunity to apply your strong technical experience building highly reliable services on managing and orchestrating a multi-petabyte scale data lake. You enjoy working in a fast paced environment and you are able to take vague requirements and transform them into solid solutions. You are motivated by solving challenging problems, where creativity is as crucial as your ability to write code and test cases.
   



On your first day, we'll expect you to have:

 At least 3 years of professional experience as a software engineer or data engineer A BS in Computer Science or equivalent experience Strong programming skills (some combination of Python, Java, and Scala preferred) Experience writing SQL, structuring data, and data storage practices Experience with data modeling Knowledge of data warehousing concepts Experienced building data pipelines and microservices Experience with Spark, Hive, Airflow and other streaming technologies to process incredible volumes of streaming data A willingness to accept failure, learn and try again An open mind to try solutions that may seem crazy at first Experience working on Amazon Web Services (in particular using EMR, Kinesis, RDS, S3, SQS and the like)





It's preferred, but not required, that you have:

 Experience building self-service tooling and platforms Built and designed Kappa architecture platforms A passion for building and running continuous integration pipelines. Built pipelines using Databricks and well versed with their API’s Contributed to open source projects (Ex: Operators in Airflow) 





Our perks & benefits



 To support you at work and play, our perks and benefits include ample time off, an annual education budget, paid volunteer days, and so much more.
   


 About Atlassian



 The world’s best teams work better together with Atlassian. From medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, Atlassian software products help teams all over the planet. At Atlassian, we're motivated by a common goal: to unleash the potential of every team.

Overall, you will be given a lot of freedom to decide the best way for you to work and also what and how you'd like to grow.

HMRC transformation

 HM Revenue and Customs is currently going through an exciting ten-year transformation programme to create a tax authority fit for the future. As part of this, we are committed to providing high-quality jobs and giving employees a great place to work, whichever location you work from. 
       
 HM Revenue and Customs has made significant progress with its plans to locate in 13 large, modern, flexible offices, equipped with high-speed digital infrastructure supporting improved customer service and compliance activity. These collaborative workspaces will enable smarter working and great training and development facilities, allowing for the sharing of expertise, local training, promotion, and provide great ongoing career development opportunities. 
       
 These offices will be located in central locations in the following towns and cities close to accessible transport links: Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Croydon and Stratford. 
       
 In addition, there will also be a small number of specialist sites where the work cannot be done anywhere else, in Gartcosh (near Glasgow), Telford, Ipswich, Worthing and Dover, as well as our headquarters in central London. What’s more, our Welsh language service has people located in Porthmadog, as well as Cardiff. 
       
 We are letting you know about our future plans because if you are recruited into an office that is not one of these locations, you will be expected, subject to HM Revenue and Customs applicable policies, to move to one of these locations in the future. In some cases, this will be via one of our nine transitional sites. 
       
 For more information please contact the vacancy holder. 
       

Terms and Conditions

 We really hope you decide to apply for this role. If you’re successful you need to know that in February 2021 members of recognised trade unions (ARC and PCS) voted to approve a pay and contract reform offer. This means that HMRC will adopt new terms and conditions for all colleagues as part of a multi-year pay deal and contract offer, the pay deal period is 01 June 2020 – 31st May 2023 and terms and conditions changes take place from the 01 June 2021 onwards. These terms will apply to colleagues who already work in HMRC and if you join us, it will apply to you too. We’ve put together a summary of the key changes that will be made and you can find this attached to the Job Advert. 
       

Pay

 If you are currently working for an OGD and would like to consider the impact on your pay when joining HMRC, please see the attached document 'Pay on Transfer from OGD' for further information. (Please note the attached document could also be called “Combined T&C and OGD Pay English”) 
       
 New entrants are expected to join on the minimum of the pay band. 
       

Further Information

 Customer facing roles in HMRC require the ability to converse at ease with members of the public and provide advice in accurate spoken English and/or Welsh where required. Where this is an essential requirement this will be tested as part of the selection process.

 HMRC welcomes applications from those who need to work a more flexible arrangement and will agree to requests where possible, taking into account our operational and customer service needs. We can’t guarantee that we can meet all requests to work flexibly, as agreement will be subject to business ability to accommodate, and any request to work a more flexible arrangement should be made prior to your acceptance of the provisional offer.

AT ADIDAS WE HAVE A WINNING CULTURE. BUT TO WIN, PHYSICAL POWER IS NOT ENOUGH. JUST LIKE ATHLETES OUR EMPLOYEES NEED MENTAL STRENGTH IN THEIR GAME. WE FOSTER THE ATHLETE‘S MINDSET THROUGH A SET OF BEHAVIORS THAT WE WANT TO ENABLE AND DEVELOP IN OUR PEOPLE AND THAT ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR UNIQUE COMPANY CULTURE – THE 3CS: CONFIDENCE, COLLABORATION AND CREATIVITY.
CONFIDENCE allows athletes to make quick decisions on the field, to reach higher. For us at adidas confidence means acknowledging that we don’t have all the answers. But we are willing to take risks, we try new things. And if we fail, then this is part of our learning – it helps us improve.
COLLABORATION. Every elite athlete relies on partners: coaches, teammates, and nutritionists. We, too, know that we are stronger together. Winning as one team takes open and candid dialogue, inclusiveness and trust in each other’s abilities and talents.
Being the best sports company in the world takes CREATIVITY. No great athlete succeeds by copying their predecessors’ training plans and strategies. We have to be open to new ideas, explore, gain an edge and stand out. Only then can we succeed.
ADIDAS CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, SUPPORTS INCLUSIVENESS AND ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUAL EXPRESSION IN OUR WORKPLACE. WE DO NOT TOLERATE THE HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION TOWARD ANY OF OUR APPLICANTS OR EMPLOYEES. WE ARE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

  A brilliant data engineering opportunity ~ not your typical, nor your status quo….
  
 Come and link arms with a wonderful data team made up of Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Analytics Engineer and Product Manager. This team has a whole lotta spunk, heart, spark and diversity and I LOVE working with them….and I think you will too.
  
 So thinking of something new and want to play a part in building out the data engineering and analytics capability of a scaling tech leader? You’ll join Australia’s darlin’ tech business 99designs, who uses modern tech, powering an array of microservices across the AWS ecosystem and the latest data tools such as Airbyte, dbt, Looker, Snowflake, Segment and Mode ~ all the tools for you to do your thang!
  

Let’s take a look at 99designs by Vista
 99designs by Vista is the world’s global creative platform that makes it easy for clients and designers to work together to create designs they love. Since 2008, their freelance community has brought more than one million creative projects to life for thousands of genius entrepreneurs, savvy small business owners, and brands with big ideas. As part of the Vista family, which includes VistaPrint and VistaCreate, 99designs helps small businesses thrive with expert design at their fingertips.
  

So what’s this role all about I hear you ask?
 It’s absolutely about having conversations with product delivery teams to understand their and the end-users’ needs, and supporting their efforts with your data modeling expertise. It’s being curious, unafraid to dive head first into different product domains and partner with product teams and data analysts to build data models that can be easily used, and having the ability to translate application logic into business logic.
  
 It's also about helping to build out data products and features from scratch. Think enhancing their data modeling, scaling out analytics platforms, and contributing to ML infrastructure that powers personalisation, fraud detection, and an array of recommendation engines.
  

A little bit about you
 Working for a scaling technology business is something you understand and love, and you know what it means to be part of an agile product team, with some experience building data products from the ground up.
  
 You are comfortable defining what great looks like in an organisation, and can contribute to a data best practice environment.
  
 More importantly, you are a brilliant communicator and love solving problems that add real value. 99d is a collaborative and innovative group, so having a positive and curious mindset, and taking initiative and ownership - well it just comes second nature to you!
  
 You have solid commercial experience in data engineering and ideally have Kimball modeling experience. You can build data pipelines that are reliable, efficient, and scalable, with extensive programming skills primarily in Python or Go as well as experience with DevOps tools in particular Docker, Git, and AWS.
  

The techy bits
 99designs mainly uses modern tech: Golang, Python, Typescript/GraphQL/React across a range of AWS services. On the data side, there’s dbt, Looker, Segment, Mode, Snowflake.
  

Why 99designs by Vista?
 As 99designs continues to scale as part of the Vista family, they are committed to building an inclusive and diverse team that reflects the communities in which they operate. They want people to feel like they belong and can bring their whole selves to work. Their aim is to continue to foster a collaborative environment with a keen focus on innovation, growth and ownership. Below are just some of the things they do to support their people:
  

Career development and learning in whatever way suits you! Think paid R&D days, courses, formal and informal mentoring, conferences… however you learn best 99d has got you covered.
Culture of workplace flexibility and wellness. Study? Parent juggling? Everyone has different needs and the business will support you in the best way we can. Some people work remotely, some with flex start and finish times...the common thread is it’s all about your individual needs. With annual wellness bonuses of $605 + annually refreshing your WFH space with $300, you'll be supported to do your thang.
Support for working parents. 18 weeks paid parental leave policy for all parents (they don't distinguish between a primary and secondary carer), which can be accessed part time or any way you want it over the first 18 months, which you can access from day 1 of joining them. They also pay superannuation for paid and unpaid parental leave for 18months!
Support for the community. In addition to 99nonprofits, 99designs provide one paid volunteer day a year for you to support a charity and the community as you see fit!
99d are also a Proud Code Like a Girl Gold Partner, host of Girl Geek Academy hack days, & maintain popular open source projects, and support a range of other community groups. It’s in their DNA.

So have we piqued your interest? Apply, say hi! We’d love to chat.

Location: Twinkl HQ, Sheffield (remote working optional)
 Annual Salary: £25,000 - £29,000 Contract: Permanent  Line Manager: George Mulroy  Recruiter: Rikki Spencer-Cox
As a new member of the Twinkl data team you’ll be joining our established analytics network of 15+ data scientists and data analysts during an exciting period of growth (10 additional hires planned!). Working closely with the Head of Data and other experienced data scientists, you will be at the forefront of how analytics is used at Twinkl; tasked with ensuring that we derive the maximum value possible from our rich and varied datasets (over 10 trillion data points at the last count!).
Dependant on your interests and experience, you will work in one or more of the following data scientist teams: 

The Key Algorithms team: ensuring that every one of our key customer-facing algorithms (recommendations, internal search, etc) is providing the best possible website experience for every one of our customers.
The Key Subscription Metrics team: making sure that our product helps as many customers as possible by maximising subscription uptake measures such as activation, retention, upgrade and winback rate.
The Data Reporting Team: finding new ways to take data reporting to the next level and facilitate the entire business to make data-driven decisions.
The Projects team: prioritising high value data-driven projects on an ad-hoc basis to ensure that our data assets are continuously being leveraged to add the highest level of value to the organisation.

In the data team how you achieve your task is 100% over to you: no one is going to be prescribing exactly what to do, or exactly how to do it (although you’ll have a strong network of experienced Data Scientists to help you out!). To be successful you’ll need to innovate, chat with key stakeholders, and read up on best practices in order to identify and implement the most appropriate data-led solution (see ‘ongoing projects’ below to see the exciting projects the current team are working on!)
You will find the data team regularly using SQL, Python, GA, Elasticsearch and BigQuery; as well as Jira and GSheets for project management. Depending on the challenge at hand, we also use Tableau for in-depth visualisations, and big data technologies to implement machine learning solutions that Python can’t handle. Don’t worry if you’ve not used all these techs before - we’re not necessarily looking for someone with lots of experience with these languages specifically, it’s an insatiable curiosity and innate ability to think logically that we’re most interested in.
 Ongoing projects:

Leveraging our recommendation systems to preempt customer need and email them the teaching resources they need for the coming week, before they know they need them.

Location: Twinkl HQ, Sheffield (remote working optional)
 Annual Salary: £35,000 + Contract: Permanent  Line Manager: George Mulroy  Recruiter: Rikki Spencer-Cox
As a new member of the Twinkl data team you’ll be joining our established analytics network of 15+ data scientists and data analysts during an exciting period of growth (10 additional hires planned!). Working closely with the Head of Data and other experienced data scientists, you will be at the forefront of how analytics is used at Twinkl; tasked with ensuring that we derive the maximum value possible from our rich and varied datasets (over 10 trillion data points at the last count!).
Dependant on your interests and experience, you will work in one or more of the following data scientist teams: 

The Key Algorithms team: ensuring that every one of our key customer-facing algorithms (recommendations, internal search, etc) is providing the best possible website experience for every one of our customers.
The Key Subscription Metrics team: making sure that our product helps as many customers as possible by maximising subscription uptake measures such as activation, retention, upgrade and winback rate.
The Data Reporting Team: finding new ways to take data reporting to the next level and facilitate the entire business to make data-driven decisions.
The Projects team: prioritising high value data-driven projects on an ad-hoc basis to ensure that our data assets are continuously being leveraged to add the highest level of value to the organisation.

In the data team how you achieve your task is 100% over to you: no one is going to be prescribing exactly what to do, or exactly how to do it (although you’ll have a strong network of experienced Data Scientists to help you out!). To be successful you’ll need to innovate, chat with key stakeholders, and read up on best practices in order to identify and implement the most appropriate data-led solution (see ‘ongoing projects’ below to see the exciting projects the current team are working on!)
You will find the data team regularly using SQL, Python, GA, Elasticsearch and BigQuery; as well as Jira and GSheets for project management. Depending on the challenge at hand, we also use Tableau for in-depth visualisations, and big data technologies to implement machine learning solutions that Python can’t handle. Don’t worry if you’ve not used all these techs before - we’re not necessarily looking for someone with lots of experience with these languages specifically, it’s an insatiable curiosity and innate ability to think logically that we’re most interested in.
 Ongoing projects:

Leveraging our recommendation systems to preempt customer need and email them the teaching resources they need for the coming week, before they know they need them.
Continuous collaboration with the conversion rate optimisation team to test and improve all touchpoints of the user experience in a data led progression.
Blending traditional search engine logic (think TF-IDF) with cutting edge machine techniques in order to provide the best possible search experience.
Using a hybrid collaborative-filtering approach to show the most relevant resource page recommendations on each of our 500 000 resource pages.

Afin d'améliorer le positionnement-prix de l'ensemble des gammes et produits, vous créerez un outil permettant la mise en place d'une mini-marketplace.
Contrairement au secteur de l'édition où un identifiant unique et très répandu (comme l'ISBN) existe, l'information sur les vins et spiritueux, tels que l'EAN, l'UDC ou le GTIN, ne sont pas systématiquement présents ni universellement reconnus sur l'intégralité des sites d'e-commerce. Afin de pallier cette limite technique et informationnelle, l'objectif sera d'utiliser des techniques à la frontière entre le traitement automatique des langues (NLP), l'image processing et le machine learning, voire le Deep Learning, afin de collecter de manière automatique sur internet les informations pertinentes concernant l'état du marché de la vente des vins et spiritueux.
Pour ce faire, il conviendra de créer un corpus et/ou un dictionnaire adapté à la recherche de mots-clés, et surtout de leur combinaison ordonnée, mais également la mise en place d'un processus automatisable de mise à jour de ce corpus et de son enrichissement régulier avec l'ensemble des données disponibles publiquement (internet, ou autre catalogue public à disposition).
Le but, in fine, étant d'identifier de manière unique l'ensemble des produits commercialisés et d'établir un processus d'appariement prix-nom précis, effectif et aisé à mettre à jour.
Diplôme d'école d'ingénieur ou universitaire, en lettres et applications quantitatives, sociologie appliquée, mathématiques appliquées, ou équivalents.
Expérience significative (5 ans et plus) dans le domaine de la Data Science. - Expérience dans le domaine de la recherche (Master Recherche / Phd.) appréciable.
Profil recherché : - Autonome - Curieux et pro-actif - Agile intellectuellement - Appétence pour le travail en équipe
Connaissances souhaitées : - Techniques d'apprentissage automatique et statistique - Expertise en NLP et Image Processing - Connaissances des modèles de Machine Learning basiques (régression linéaire et logistique, arbre de décision, SVM, plus proches voisins, k-means, etc.) - Maîtrise de Python et des librairies pertinentes (Beautifulsoup, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, Scikit-Image, OpenCV, Mahotas) - Appétence pour développement et l'intégration informatique -

PARTNERSCHAFT, DIE VORAN BRINGT


 Wer neue Wege erschließen will, muss bewerten, was da ist, kritisch sein und Dinge hinterfragen. Dazu muss man auch mal Stolpersteine überwinden. Wir suchen Analytiker und Vordenker, die sich davon nicht beirren lassen. Die ihr Know-how in Lösungen gießen wollen, die Nutzen stiften und weiterbringen. Welchen Weg du und dein Team zu diesem Ziel wählen, ist dabei zweitrangig. Solange der Output stimmt – so einfach ist das.
   

     Schlag mit uns ein neues Karriere-Kapitel auf: Was für den Output gilt, gilt für den Input natürlich auch – ist doch klar, dass wir in puncto IT und Technik immer daran arbeiten, up-to-date zu sein. In einem Umfeld, in dem Ideen auf offene Ohren treffen, Projekte schnell ins Rollen kommen, „monoton“ ein Fremdwort ist und es für Feedback klare Regeln gibt. Denn auch Kritik muss Hand und Fuß haben – das gehört für uns zum Thema Wertschätzung und Kommunikation dazu. Sagen, was man denkt und meinen, was man sagt. Heißt natürlich auch, dass wir dich mit offenen Armen empfangen, unabhängig von Geschlecht, Herkunft, sexueller Orientierung, einer Behinderung oder anderen Facetten.
   


 Benefits


     Um mit unseren Mitarbeitern die Versicherung der Zukunft zu gestalten, sorgen wir für einen bunten Rahmen mit breit gefächerten Möglichkeiten – auskömmliche Sozialleistungen und verschiedenste Services vor Ort inklusive. Zwischendurch schnell mal was erledigen? Kein Problem, ist erlaubt. Schnell von „A nach B“ kommen? Car-Sharing macht’s möglich. Fit und gesund in den Tag starten? Unser betriebliches Gesundheitsmanagement unterstützt dich dabei von der Prävention bis hin zu Kooperationen mit Gesundheitsanbietern.
   


 Neben einem attraktiven Gehalt bieten wir dir also darüber hinaus auch noch diverse Extras und Zusatzleistungen, wie:
   


 flexible Arbeitszeiten | work@home | individuelle Förderung | Lunch-Angebote | Sportangebot
   





 AXA gehört zu den weltweit führenden Versicherungsunternehmen und Vermögensmanager mit Tätigkeitsschwerpunkten in Europa, Nordamerika und dem asiatisch-pazifischen Raum. Hier in Deutschland zählen wir zu den größten Erstversicherern. Wir möchten unsere Position als Innovationstreiber der Branche stetig weiter ausbauen. Vor allem aber tun wir alles dafür, unseren Kunden einen echten Mehrwert zu bieten – mit erstklassigem Service und wirkungsvollen Produkten am Puls der Zeit.
   



 BOCK AUF NEUES? BOCK AUF AXA!



    Bei AXA setzen wir auf Transparenz und ein offenes Arbeitsumfeld. Daher führen wir für alle Kandidaten, die erfolgreich die letzte Stufe des Auswahlprozesses erreicht haben, ein Pre-Employment Screening durch.

Dat heb je ook zelf in de hand! Want als Data Scientist bij IVO Rechtspraak werk je in een datalab in oprichting. We maken als onderdeel van de Rechtspraak de Nederlandse rechtspraak digitaal toegankelijk. Met experimenten help jij rechters en andere medewerkers van de Rechtspraak meer datagedreven en dus beter te werken. Daarbij pas je de nieuwste technologieën toe. Spannend en ontzettend belangrijk!
Hoe je werk eruitziet
De Rechtspraak wil flinke stappen zetten in datagedreven werken. Vanuit het IVO Datalab krijg je alle ruimte om daar met experimenten aan bij te dragen. Je eigen team is jong en klein, maar je werkt nauw samen met data-analisten en data scientists van onder meer het datalab van het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid en het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut. Genoeg sparringpartners en collega’s dus om nieuwe casussen en data-analyses op te pakken!
Bij het IVO Datalab kun je je creativiteit helemaal kwijt. Samen met collega-data scientists, juridisch medewerkers en rechters ontwikkel je allerlei analyseproducten. Dat gaat van een analyse op de datakwaliteit tot het inzetten van de nieuwste technieken voor natural language processing om relevante tekst uit een uitspraak te halen. En hoe geweldig is het om mee te werken aan een model dat alle uitspraken anonimiseert? Daarmee kunnen we ze online openbaar maken voor het publiek of wetenschappelijk onderzoek.
Aan de hand van experimenten inspireer je medewerkers van de Rechtspraak over de mogelijkheden van datagedreven werken. Zo vergroot je de datageletterdheid binnen de Rechtspraak. Dat betekent natuurlijk ook dat je goed duidelijk moet maken wat er kan en hoe dit helpt om beter te werken. Ook onderwerpen als privacy, ethiek en het operationaliseren van machine learning algoritmes staan op de agenda. Wat zijn bijvoorbeeld de randvoorwaarden om een AI-model in productie te nemen? En hoe houden we rekening met de menselijke maat bij de inzet van algoritmes? Jij denkt er allemaal over mee!
Hou je niet van een gespreid bedje, maar wel van uitdagingen, kansen en de ruimte om je ideeën in de praktijk te brengen? Dan is dit dé baan voor jou!
Wat we je bieden
Om te beginnen een leuke, informele werksfeer. We houden de lijnen graag kort! En je arbeidsvoorwaarden zijn prima geregeld volgens de CAO Rijk. Wat belangrijke punten op een rij:
Je salaris is maximaal € 5.139 op basis van 36-urige werkweek. Je zit in schaal 11.
Je krijgt een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB) van maximaal € 841 bruto per maand (16,37%). Dit is inclusief je vakantiegeld en eindejaarsuitkering. Je kunt dit budget bijvoorbeeld laten uitkeren of in vrije dagen omzetten.
Je houdt werk en privé prima in balans, bijvoorbeeld door thuis te werken, de mogelijkheid van 4×9 uur of ouderschapsverlof. Bovendien krijg je 144 vakantie- en 21,6 IKB-uren op basis van een 36-urige werkweek.
Binnen de IVO Academy krijg je alle ruimte en is er volop aandacht voor jouw persoonlijke én vaktechnische ontwikkeling.
Bij IVO Rechtspraak stimuleren we reizen met het OV! Je krijgt een OV-chipkaart waarmee je gratis voor je werk reist.
Je pensioen is goed geregeld via het ABP.
Je krijgt in eerste instantie een jaarcontract. Functioneer je goed, dan wordt dit een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.

Meer informatie over onze arbeidsvoorwaarden vind je op www.p-direkt.nl.

Wat we van je vragen
Dit zijn de dingen waar je volgens het ideaalplaatje aan voldoet:
Je hebt minimaal twee jaar relevante werkervaring als Data Scientist
Je hebt uitgebreide kennis en ervaring op het gebied van statistische methodes en technieken, zoals beslisbomen, clustering, named entity recognition en process mining
Je kunt je mondeling en schriftelijk uitstekend uitdrukken: je weet complexe dataprojecten te vertalen naar de business en brengt de uitkomsten van een project helder over aan mensen van verschillende niveaus
Je bent proactief en herkent en creëert op basis van je eigen kennis en ervaring initiatieven voor data science
Je hebt hands-on-ervaring met programmeren in Python (of een vergelijkbare programmeertaal zoals R of Scala)

Kom je bij ons werken, dan vragen we ook altijd een Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag.

Senior Data Analyst | 27

I started my career in PwC Assurance almost three years ago after finishing my degree within big data and economics. After two years of working in Audit, I found my professional interest to tend towards analytics, programming and development. As a result I was hired into PwC TechLabs as a consultant. Now I get to work both with complex and interesting problems by solving client cases through analytics and optimization, as well as internal projects to digitize how PwC delivers values to its customers.

Up until very recently spent one and a half months solving a client's dispute with a supplier using python and advanced modeling. I also get to do the best of both worlds as I am not only on client engagements but also play a key role in prototyping PwC products. This is one of the aspects I love about my job, as I get to spend a lot of time on trial and error while developing applications using Azure and other tools - as long as there is a feasible business case to be made. In TechLabs you also get to enjoy autonomy as the organizational structure is lean and you often have responsibility for your own projects. While at the same time I can always brainstorm with my colleagues if I am feeling stuck.

Data Scientist | 27

I have a background as an Industrial and Management Systems Engineer and all previous work experience was mostly within Supply Chain. Upon finishing my masters degree I wanted to get more into data analytics, but this can be a hard sell with relatively sparse coding experience and little knowledge of the softwares used in the field. Fortunately PwC saw my potential and the willingness to learn, and I was brought on as a Data Analyst.

Since then I have been exposed to numerous new technologies and related challenges and I am enjoying the ever expanding expanse of learning opportunities . Our team works fast paced and you are constantly working with new projects. The backlog of projects has allowed me to cherry pick several of my projects, so that I could work with customers or technology I wanted to be exposed to. Continuous learning is both a perk and a must in this job, but you are not alone. At PwC you are a part of a strong Technology community among many more consultants and there’s almost always someone that has already been exposed to some variety of the challenges you are facing. In addition, I have experienced a large amount of freedom in how, when and where I work. Being able to tailor the workday to your own needs is definitely another perk of this job.

Senior Data Scientist | 29

After finishing my degree in Computational Physics, I wanted to broaden my horizon and get to know more about the different industries out there, while at the same time applying the knowledge I had acquired. That is why I chose PwC. As a multidisciplinary professional services firm you will work together with experts on projects across sectors where your expertise will be one piece of the puzzle that is the final solution.

During my time at PwC I have discovered that I really enjoy working together with domain experts and finding new ways to solve their problems. We do not specialize in any particular tools, but choose the ones that best fit the business case. This requires you to be creative, open and willing to learn new things. I have explored business cases and prototyped new services and products related to tax, sustainability and forensics, among others.

About the Role
 

         They say no man is an island, and this holds true here at Gojek. As our Data Scientist, you’ll be part of the data team that directly impacts Gojek’s GoFood. Your main objective will be to create business impact at scale. The Business and Product Team will be your companions during this ride. Best yet, you’ll have the opportunity to flex your analytics and DS skills!. What differentiates Gojek from other companies is the pace at which you can see your analysis and insights come to life and impact of millions of customers and thousands of merchants partners
        


What You Will Do

Work with Data Scientists, Product Engineers and Product Managers to build, deploy, and scale Data Science solutions for recommendation systems and Geospatial data.
 Develop theoretical models to better understand our customers’ use-cases and needs.
 Work with Product teams to continuously refine, improve the solutions to cater to ever-changing Gojek needs
 Deep-dive analysis to support business decisions

What You Will Need

Bachelor’s / Master’s degree in either Statistics, Econometrics Mathematics or Computer Science
 1-2 years of exposure to Machine Learning (forecasting, clustering, statistical significance test, predictive modeling, and text mining)
 Comfortable in a programming language (either R, Python) and comfortable using SQL
 Ability to use critical thinking daily to manage daily tasks while being goal-oriented



About the Team

 Our GoFood Data squad currently consists of around 20 people based in India and Indonesia who run Southeast Asia’s leading GoFood. We oversee all things data and work to become a thought partner for our Business Users, Product Team, and Decision Makers. It’s our job to ensure that they have a structural approach to data-driven problem-solving. Right now, there is only one question we try to solve in our three-way marketplace: how to make customers, drivers, and merchants happy and delighted. We have so far created millions of dollar impact across different journeys of customer - Search, Recommendations, improving discovery of merchants, predicting the food preparation time etc

 We work with the PMs hand-in-glove - be it constructing a new machine learning solution or brainstorming on a problem like how do we reduce the wait time for the drive, how do we improve assortment, should we treat convenience seeking customer differently from value seeking customer etc

 As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. Along with us coming from diverse backgrounds, we often have fun sessions to talk about everything and anything from data information to our current movie list. With WFH becoming more normalized, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone? ).
