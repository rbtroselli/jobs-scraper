Welcome to the future of energy



 We are both an electricity retailer and a tech platform and we think there is no better way to address our greatest challenge, climate change, than with the combination of those two.
   


 Through our proprietary tech platform, Kraken, we are changing the way people interact with their energy company - by making it approachable, low cost, easy-to-understand, and most importantly, 100% renewable. We’ve distinguished ourselves by being named 2020’s Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service. In many markets we are a leading employer on Glassdoor for best places to work.
   


 At Octopus Energy, we’re developing a data platform that provides data services to all our retail energy businesses around the world. The platform enables self-service of data analytics to hundreds of data hungry users as well as automation of all our data workflows from simple ETL jobs to ML training and prediction. The data platform team works across the whole customer domain on anything from marketing campaign optimization to helping our traders buy the right amount of energy.
   


 Octopus Energy is growing fast and that means lots of data that needs to be ingested, organized, analyzed and shared with the team. We’re looking for a data engineer that can help us with this challenge. You’ll work across all different parts of the business to understand what our team’s needs and deliver data pipelines and tools to meet them. Because it’s still early days, you’ll need to be versatile and be equally comfortable building robust production ready pipelines or hacking together a quick script to run on your machine. You’ll spend most of your time engineering but you should also enjoy analyzing data and building data interfaces like Tableau dashboards or data applications.
   


 You’ll be part of our global data platform team who will provide dev ops and infrastructure support and technical guidance. We’re building a consistent data platform across all Octopus retail businesses in UK, US, Germany, Spain, Japan and NZ so you’ll be part of and contribute to a global data community.
   



What you'll do 

Work with the data scientists and data analysts to scope out and plan new data sources and pipelines Build, automate, deploy and maintain data pipelines Build Streamlet data apps and lend a hand building and maintaining Tableau dashboards Work with the global data platform team to deploy new tools and services into the US data environment Participate in and contribute to our global data community Build the infrastructure required for optimal extraction, transformation, and loading of data from a wide variety of data sources Use an analytical, data-driven approach to drive a deep understanding of fast changing business Build large-scale batch and real-time data pipelines with data processing frameworks in Amazon Web Services, Azure or GCP cloud platform





What you'll need 

First and foremost, we want our data engineers to be great software engineers with a passion for writing high quality code It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order): Python (in combination with Data Pipelines and Analytics) Advanced SQL knowledge and experience working with relational databases, query authoring (SQL) as well as working familiarity with a variety of databases. Experience modeling data for analytics - ideally experience using dbt as a modeling tool Experience building data pipelines in a cloud environment (ideally AWS) Spark The projects will be varied and we’re looking for someone who can work autonomously and proactively to scope problems and solve and deliver pragmatic solutions We want someone who is passionate about building great data tools for our business teams





Why else you'll love it here

 Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs. Unlimited paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need. 401(k) plan with employer match. Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible. Pre-tax commuter benefits. Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance. Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such. Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location. Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! When on a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!





If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you. 




At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership status, pregnancy and maternity status, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation.
