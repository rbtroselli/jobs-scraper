In 2017, John founded RockITek to focus exclusively on emerging and niche technology that provide new, enhanced, and even radical approaches to cybersecurity challenges. By focusing on the Presales Data Engineer needs of our partners and truly partnering with them to augment their capabilities, we accelerate their adoption into the Government space.
It's this relationship with our teaming partners that sets us apart from typical government technology distributors. We don't just sell their products, we join forces with them to accelerate their growth in the government market. As a result, our partners innovate technologies that are enabling key initiatives, like secure telework throughout the US Government, and experiencing two-year growth rates similar to the 264% that we realized.

Like our Business Model, Our Culture is Different
Everyone in our company has the responsibility to speak up and the authority to make decisions, which is the best way to solve problems. We're a place where you can feel comfortable being yourself and bringing your unique talents and ideas to make a direct impact.
“Every member of our team is a critical component to not only RockITek's success, but also the success of our partners and customers. They are empowered, trusted, and responsible for managing their own day, workload, and deadlines. At RockITek, we take the time to strategize, ideate, and support each other without the fear of judgement or criticism because we are all focused on the end goal: client success.” John Sobczak, RockITek CEO
“While we don't take ourselves too seriously, we do take our mission very seriously. If we don't see value or aren't enjoying doing what we do, we stop and reassess why we're doing it at all.” Tina Scogin, Director of Business Operations

We Got You… Covered
Our benefits package is designed to show our appreciation for those who choose to join and advance the RockITek mission, which is to accelerate the adoption of emerging cybersecurity solutions into government space.

We are a remote first, 100% cloud-based organization. If you want company, we do have an office in Bel Air, MD.

Growth with a Purpose
 ShoppingGives began in 2015 as an organization to do good and make an impact. We build products to address the expectation for change. We exist to create impact on every purchase, and we believe that micro-actions lead to macro impact. Every day we help retailers, no matter how large or small, give back to the causes that their customers are passionate about. Through everyday purchases, we get to watch the world around us become better one transaction at a time, and we think that's pretty incredible. Our impact is enormous and why we are growing with a purpose. We know it's best to Invest in Tomorrow, Today. That means we don't skip any steps while planning or default to the solutions we are comfortable with - we research tomorrow's leading technologies and how they can benefit our products. 

Have you ever wondered what it feels like to enjoy coming to work every day? Making an Impact with every keystroke? How about smacking tennis balls with Serena Williams on a Tuesday at lunch? Okay technically that third one we can't make happen but Serena is an early investor in ShoppingGives - and two out of three isn't bad!
 We are an impact-driven organization that thrives on a collaborative, openly communicative, and hyper transparent environment. How many more months/years are you going to spend working for organizations that think diversity is a four-letter word. At ShoppingGives we don't believe in a glass ceiling since we are a startup and we haven't gotten around to building one yet!
 The bottom line at the top - we make the world a better place with the tools we design and build.
 Let's define 'Data Engineer' as we see it. You love to and are great at:

Enhancing Data across Development, Test, QA, UAT/Staging, and Production environments.
Managing and maintaining Databases across AWS environments; includes all aspects of managing and enhancing data/databases or data platforms.
Execute in designing and building a complete Business analytics dashboard for Reporting or action-based decision-making platforms.

One year of experience working in the Agile Development Methodology; using tools like Jira is an added plus.
One year of experience unit testing, debugging and documenting Data Models.
One year of working in an AWS Environment (preferred)

Let's be transparent: This job isn't for everyone.

Our mission drives our team to do good.
We work hard and deliver fast - we have lots of customers to keep on our platform.
Willy Wonka doesn't work here - so we don't sugarcoat.
Mistakes are forgivable, and inactivity is not.
We're accountable to you because you'll be accountable to us.

 Your mission:
 Enhance our AWS platform that allows us to turn data into insights.

 If you think you're a fit or want to know more - apply right now!
 Read this if you don't meet 100% of the requirements:

Project Description: 
Our vision is to realize the potential of the animals we live with. We are looking for enthusiastic and committed people to join us in this pursuit. We are studying tools for teaching non-human animals how to express themselves using sound buttons. 
Fellowship Description: 
We are looking for curious, research-oriented fellows able to help us develop, analyze and innovate research on how animals express themselves using sound buttons. While fellows will be employed by CleverPet, makers of FluentPet, their primary role will be in supporting the current research as part of the How.TheyCanTalk.org (http://how.theycantalk.org/) Research Initiative, which is a combination of an open research project and online community.
Accepted research fellows will engage directly with the animal communication research being performed. Depending on the fellowship's focus, this will involve a combination of data organization and management, data analysis, and literature review, among other tasks. Fellows will be supervised by and engage directly with members of the How.TheyCanTalk.org (http://how.theycantalk.org/) and CleverPet leadership teams.
The data we are collecting and organizing in the How.TheyCanTalk Research Initiative will be shared with the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at UC San Diego, and thus this fellowship will provide avenues for potential scholarly collaboration and publication development. We expect such collaborations to help fellows advance their careers, academic or otherwise. 
Data Engineer
Description:
This role will assist in the organization, collection, and analysis of a massive naturalistic observational dataset on button pressing and associated behaviors by non-human animals. You will be a part of a team working with various kinds of data from surveys to thousands of hours of multi-camera video. You will specifically help process and organize incoming observational data as well as build tools to help analyze this data. These tools might include filters that find relevant data or tools that might help researchers search and annotate this data.
Requirements:

Experience managing and working with relational databases is strongly preferred
 Experience with python is strongly preferred
 Experience with Linux and the command line is strongly preferred
 Familiarity with image/video data is a plus, e.g., ffmpeg or gstreamer
 Familiarity with computer vision is a plus, e.g., image recognition or motion detection, etc.

 Timeline and compensation:
Our proposed fellowships are for 12 weeks this summer and are open to all qualified, interested, and motivated students. These fellowships are entirely remote and will come with compensation of $7,500 for the duration of the anticipated 12 weeks. Funding is guaranteed for all accepted students. Any required travel will be reimbursed.
The suggested start date is June 6th, although this can be adjusted to match fellows' availability. In May, we will review applications between May 2nd and May 20th.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

Loom makes it easy to record quick videos of your screen and camera and instantly share them with a link. More than 14M users across more than 200k companies around the world trust Loom to share feedback, updates, intros, training, and more – every day. Founded in late 2015, Loom has raised $203M from world-class investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Iconic, and Coatue.
The Role
We're looking to add a Senior Data Engineer to our growing Data team to help us build the data foundation that will enable data science and analytics to derive insights and build models that will unlock the next stage of Loom's growth.

You will be collaborating with the data team, engineering team & stakeholders across the company to build the foundation of our data infrastructure. You will take ownership of the transformation layer from raw data to the models that drive all critical analysis and dashboards across the organization. We are looking for a SQL wizard trained in the arts of performant & well-documented query writing, a Python expert, someone who puts data quality first, and someone that can translate business problems into technical models that drive actionable insight.

We are currently hiring remotely in the United States and Canada
Responsibilities
Help build data foundation, data pipelines and ETL that enable the creation of insightful automated dashboards and data visualization to track key business metrics.
Partner with data, engineering and business teams to translate business problems into technical projects and infrastructure that drives business results.
Drive table design and architecture, transformation logic and efficient query development to support the growing needs of the data organization.
Automate analyses and data pipelines while building scalable data infrastructure, to enable self-serve dashboards and automation of product experimentation results.
Create and manage Data Integrations between the Snowflake Data Warehouse and 3rd party tools such as Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom, etc.
Develop testing and monitoring across the transformation layer to ensure data quality from raw sources and all models downstream.
Build out documentation that supports code maintainability and ultimately a Data Dictionary that makes data accessible to the whole company.
What We're Looking For
5+ years experience in a data engineering or data science role
Strong communication skills to work with stakeholders to translate business needs and ideas into tractable technical work items.
Proficiency in SQL and database table design - able to write structured and efficient queries on large data sets.
Experience with ETL tools such as Airflow or DBT.
Proficiency in Python and/or R
Experience working in the command line and in git workflows.

How We Work
Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this 'sync time' is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

Perks at Loom
Competitive compensation and equity package
99% company paid medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and dependents (for US employees)
Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA)
Healthcare reimbursement (for International employees)
Life, AD&D, Short and Long Term Disability Insurance

Our mission is to change the way the world works by democratizing AI for every business, and to build a great company – that everyone loves being a part of. These two goals haven't changed since the days when Peak was little more than an idea forming in the heads of our founders Richard, Atul and Dave.

It's an incredibly exciting time at Peak; we're growing rapidly off the back of our $75m Series C funding round (2021), led by SoftBank, and we have very ambitious plans for the future.

We're opening up the Peak platform to more organizations, empowering businesses to now build their own Decision Intelligence solutions and applications for the very first time.

We're passionate about creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for those of all ages, religions, sexual orientations, socio-economic status and for those with disabilities.

We are looking for a skilled Data Engineer to work as part of the Customer Integration team to make the Peak platform, even better!

We're an innovative tech consultancy - a team of problem solvers. Since 1993 we've been finding better ways to solve complex technology problems for some of the world's leading organisations and delivered solutions that millions of people use every day.

We bring together experts from diverse backgrounds and experiences in a collaborative and open culture to deliver outstanding outcomes for our clients, and a stimulating and rewarding environment for our people.

We are DataOps advocates and use software engineering best practices to build scalable and re-usable data solutions to help clients use their data to gain insights, drive decisions and deliver business value. Clients don't engage BJSS to do the straightforward things, they ask us to help on their biggest challenges which means we get to work with a wide range of tools and technologies and there are always new things to learn.

About the Role

BJSS data engineers are specialist software engineers that build, optimise and maintain data applications, systems and services. This role combines the discipline of software engineering with the knowledge and experience of building data solutions in order to deliver business value.

As a BJSS data engineer you'll help our clients deploy data pipelines and processes in a production-safe manner, using the latest technologies and with a DataOps culture.

You'll work in a fast moving, agile environment, within multi-disciplinary teams of highly skilled consultants, delivering modern data platforms into large organisations.

You can expect to get involved in variety of projects in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), learning about and using data services such as Databricks, Data Factory, Synapse, Kafka, Redshift, Glue, Athena, BigQuery, S3, Cloud Data Fusion etc.

About You
You're an engineer at heart and enjoy the challenge of building reliable, efficient data applications systems, services and platforms.
You have a good understanding of coding best practices and design patterns and experience with code and data versioning, dependency management, code quality and optimisation, error handling, logging, monitoring, validation and alerting.
You have experience in writing well tested object-oriented python.
You have experience with using CI/CD tooling to analyse, build, test and deploy your code.
You have a good understanding of design choices for data storage and data processing, with a particular focus on cloud data services.
You have experience in using parallel computing to process large datasets and to optimise computationally intensive tasks.
You have experience in programmatically deploying, scheduling and monitoring components in a workflow.
You have experience in writing complex queries against relational and non-relational data stores.
Some of the Perks
A collaborative and inspiring environment working alongside some of the best tech people in the industry
Hybrid working – you can vary your working location to allow you to collaborate better, feed your creativity, and take the time and space to focus when you need it
Training opportunities and incentives – we support professional certifications across engineering and non-engineering roles

The opportunity…
We have an exciting opportunity for a Data Engineer to join our Technology team. We’re interested in passionate data professionals who are keen to learn. This is an opportunity to work with the latest Microsoft Data Platform, which is currently being implemented in conjunction with a consultancy partner. 
You’ll either bring recent experience of this toolset, or a desire to build your skillset using the latest Microsoft technology. You’ll work with our consultancy partners to increase your knowledge, as part of a handover process, as well as having the opportunity to undertake formal training, as you feel necessary. You’ll then take on ownership of the organisation’s underlying Data Platform across all business areas.
 You should have the desire to learn, the energy and skills to make changes happen and a passion for building top-quality solutions. You should be a great team player, and keen to work in a high performing team.
 We offer a hybrid working approach, with some weekly attendance expected at our office in Basingstoke.
About Castle Trust Bank
Having become a fully authorised bank in 2020, we pride ourselves in being a fintech challenger bank, providing specialist property mortgages, retail finance lending and savings accounts to a variety of customers. Transformation of our data capabilities is seen as a key enabler to the future success of the business, so this is a high-profile project within the organisation.
What we are looking for in you
 From a technical perspective, it’s important to us that you have relevant experience in the following:

Data Integration (e.g. SSIS, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics Pipelines);
Microsoft SQL programming (e.g. using SSMS, databricks);
Data visualisation software (e.g. PowerBI);
Data modelling and data design.

What is equally important is that you are highly numerate, analytical and business value oriented, with the ability to deliver to high standards in terms of attention to detail, time, and cost. You'll be an all-round good problem solver, with excellent communication skills with the ability to communicate effectively at all levels. 
What’s in it for you…
As well as a competitive salary, we offer an annual performance related bonus based on individual and company performance. In addition, a contributory pension scheme, life assurance, 25 days annual leave (plus bank holidays on top). Wellbeing is high on our agenda, and we offer Vitality at Work membership, eye test vouchers and discounted gym membership. If that’s not enough, we offer season ticket travel loans and various discounts through Perkbox.

Caught your attention? If so, we’d love to talk to you and tell you more about what it’s like to work at Castle Trust Bank – The Place To Work!

We can all do our part in fighting food waste and do our bit to tackle climate change by reducing the amount of food wasted. Did you know that more than one third of all food produced gets thrown away? This unnecessary food waste equates to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions!

Too Good To Go is a food waste-fighting app and a certified B Corporation. We connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. We save two meals every second, all thanks to our 2+ million daily users. We have over 54 million registered app users in 17 locations across Europe, the US and North America. Together, we have saved more than 127 million meals from going to waste. We are super proud of this, but there is still lots more that we want to achieve.

What you help build will be used daily by our millions of users, our partners and our internal business stakeholders.


The role

You will be developing and maintaining our data infrastructure, using primarily AWS services, including data ingestion/export tools and our data warehouse. You will build and improve our CI/CD and monitoring systems, as well as support our analysts and analytics engineers in building efficient and scalable data pipelines.

You get to bring your own opinions and experience when it comes to the technology stack. We've kept the legacy systems to a minimum, so there is room to adapt and optimize.

Background in building scalable and data-intensive applications, ideally on cloud infrastructure. If you haven't been called a Data Engineer before, your title might have been along the lines of Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer or similar
Knowledge of CI/CD tools, Docker (ideally on Kubernetes) and/or Terraform
Knowledge of a modern workflow management platform (ideally Airflow)

Nice to have

Experience applying DevOps principles to data systems (DataOps)
Familiarity with the modern data stack
Some exposure to ML platforms.
Amazon Kinesis / event stream processing.

We fight together: food waste is a big beast to fight. We can do it if we fight together as Waste Warriors with no ego. We believe in a #oneteam.

We keep it simple: our ambitions are bold but our solutions are simple
We build a legacy: we're proud of the change we're driving.

What We Have To Offer

A rare opportunity to work in a social impact company (and certified B Corporation!) where you get to wake up every day knowing you're achieving positive change.
The experience of being part of an international company with 1350 + enthusiastic and highly talented teammates across 17 countries (and counting) – always ready to share knowledge and support!
Strong personal as well as professional development in an intense and high-growth scale-up environment.

We encourage Black, Brown, LQBTQ+, Disabled, Mums and Dads to apply!

During the application process please feel free to share which pronouns you use (she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/theirs). And please let us know if you need any reasonable adjustments for the application or the interview.
The challenge

At Audiense we process more than one thousand million social profiles. We enrich them by applying several classification and segmentation algorithms to help customers such as Twitter, Telefónica, DHL, and Puma to define their marketing campaigns, identify influencers and discover new market niches.


Our challenge is to optimise the intake, enriching and storage of that growing data asset and to bring the insights computing to be as close as possible to real time.

For that we have a pipeline that ingests data from an enriching system mainly written in Node.js. This system consumes from many third party APIs and applies algorithms to infer new characteristics. This pipeline is able to keep updating a data lake of more than 100 TB that is used to generate reports for our customers using Spark and Scala.

Most of the Data Engineering code base is written in Scala, Spark and Typescript. This codebase is used both for maintaining our data lake and consuming it.

Our current focus is migrating and refactoring all the legacy parts of the batch-oriented ETL pipeline that feeds our data lake to a more real-time, event-oriented architecture based on Kafka.


In order to tackle this challenge, we are looking for people that will feel comfortable with the wide range of skills involved, someone that will add their experience to ours and help us fill the gaps by joining our team.


All our stack is hosted in AWS, we use mainly Docker (ECS), EC2 and Lambda to execute our source code and a wide range of services like SQS and SNS for communication via events.

How do we work?

We have remote-first style work culture, and we have been working 100% remotely for more than 8 years. Although we have offices in Córdoba, our teams (management, sales, customer service, product, marketing and engineering) are distributed across different cities: London, Italy, Málaga, Barcelona, Madrid, Córdoba, Vigo, Seville, Granada, Cuenca...


Our mindset, workflows and communication assume that we are all remote. Almost everything is documented in Github: growth plans, learning path, architecture, protocols, onboarding, playbooks, design system, UX guidelines, etc. We invest everything in our power to automate our daily routines so that we can be as autonomous as possible to allow us to work remotely efficiently.

You will join a cohesive team (more than 4 years on average together) in a very collaborative environment in which you will feel cared for from the start of your onboarding.

Each team applies different agile methodologies but all follow some basic principles. We prioritize the features that bring more value to our customers and, instead of setting deadlines, we deliver small increments so that we always have a functional and deliverable version of the feature. We try to keep the number of tasks in parallel to the minimum possible. We have a few meetings scheduled but we will not miss the daily meetings, biweekly sprint planning and reviews. We have regular 1:1s with the manager and the CTO, and we do not hesitate to jump on to a hangout if a Slack or mail thread is getting longer.

We believe in extreme programming as a development technique so most of the time we do pair programming (yes, remotely) and TDD is our main tool for writing robust and testable code. Pair programming always helps us trust our code allowing for constant iterations. Once per sprint we spend time on joint code review to detect possible glitches to prioritize. We do continuous integration and we are in the process of extinguishing the branches to do trunk base development, there is a challenge here too.

The code we write today tries to respect the principles of SOLID, clean code, and we apply hexagonal architecture and domain driven design when complexity requires it. Of course, we are not going to lie to you, during 7 years we have also done a lot of bad code and antipatterns; consider it an opportunity to see real examples of what not to do and to practise refactoring techniques.

We have a culture of continuous learning and we encourage this to happen during working hours. As a team we have made a pact of following a learning path, so by joining Audiense, you are committing to it too. If you have followed a similar path, we are eager to get to know you and learn from your experiences, if you haven’t, we are looking forward to supporting you with resources, time and mentoring so that we are aligned.
What are we looking for?

We would like you to be able to read, refactor and test Spark code following good practices, to have experience with Kafka architecture patterns and the best strategies to implement them at scale. Knowledge of the datalake, datawarehouse and deltalake concepts is a plus and in general, being in touch with the data engineering field trends

We are looking for someone with experience in Scala and Spark, or at least Java with an interest in Scala, but not necessarily experience with Functional Programming since we write our code using an OO approach. Also having experience with Terraform and AWS would definitely be a plus, as is the flexibility to learn the different technologies involved in our projects. While none of these requirements is written in stone, we would like you to feel comfortable working with real-time technologies like Kafka (KStreams and KSql) and Spark Streaming.

We believe in pair programming and despite being remote we spend a great part of the day pairing, so we hope you feel comfortable with this practice.

Our stack is wide: Scala, Spark, Node.js (ES6 and Typescript), Python, React, MongoDB, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, AWS (SNS, SQS, API Gateway, Cognito, Lambda, Redshift, Aurora, DynamoDB). However, mastering them all is not a requirement. Again, mastering them all is not a requirement. We are more interested in the principles behind them.

We invest our time and support in helping each other towards continuous learning, so it is very important that you want to learn and continue practising the skills necessary to run our profession. Practise, practise, practise!

Working remotely has many advantages but also requires an extra effort of communication and responsibility, so we understand that the following skills are essential: self-management, fluid communication, respect, and inclusiveness.

What we offer?
40K€-60K€ salary.
Monthly subvention for co-workings.
Learning days. You can learn during working hours.
Training budget that includes unlimited access to SafariBooks and Coursera catalogues.
100% remote and flexible schedule.
Local and National Bank holidays.
Free day on your birthday.
Rewards for hitting quarterly targets.
Quarterly engineering meetups, 3 days of retrospective sessions, hacking, team building and leisure in Córdoba.
Yearly global all hands, 3-4 days of team building and leisure sessions for all the company.
English lessons.
Furniture/Accessories Allowance via Hofy.
2 Duvet Days per year.
Allowance towards therapy sessions.
Laptop with the possibility of choosing between Mac or PC.
Free 1Password Families Plan account.
Recruitment Process
Send an email to jobdev@audiense.com introducing yourself and telling us why you fit the profile we are looking for. Your CV will also be useful but it is not the most important.
If you pass the initial application filtering, or we contact you directly, your first interview will be with our CTO (Alfredo Artiles).
You’ll have a second interview with some members of our team. This is a good opportunity to ask questions directly to your future teammates.
Then we would look for a way to validate your skills and experiences. The best way to accomplish this is by pair programming with our team in real tasks. The more time we pair, the more we both could validate if we like each other and especially if you like our way of working, the challenge and the team. Of course we would pay for your time. If this approach doesn’t work for you, we would try to adapt to you and offer other alternatives.
If we finally convince you to join our team, this will be the ideal onboarding:
Over the first few days you will be assigned a mentor who will help you set up your computer as needed and mentor you for the following months. He will explain all the workflows that we have become familiar with and hope you will too.
From day 1 you will become a part of the usual development flow: solving team issues and deploying code to production several times a day.
As our development flow is adapted to pair programming your contribution will be very progressive, and you will always have someone to revert to with any questions you may have.

Each team can decide which technology to use that is best suited to solve their current problem. Our teams are small and work agile. We are very open minded to try out new things and contribute to open source. In corona-free times, we host and sponsor meetups and conferences, as well as organizing a yearly internal IT conference which takes place at a resort, where our customers usually enjoy their vacation.

Do you want to be part of the next generation of holidays? In a constant changing environment, HolidayCheck wants to be there when the Urlaubers look again for their greatest time of the year. We want to bring them back to the beach!
At the heart of our corporate culture are our values. We live by them every day! They have helped us create an environment of continuous personal growth and trust, where HolidayCheckers can work autonomously and with a lot of flexibility, in small, self-organised teams. We improve ourselves daily, listen carefully to our customers and deliver working software to them frequently.
Do you also share our values and are you ready for the journey with HolidayCheck? Then become part of our team!"

More about Hopper 




   Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .
   




   Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:
   




Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020. 




The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing. 




According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads. 




Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America. 




The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually. 




Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue. 




Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip. 




   The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.
   




   And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!

Tradeshift is a unicorn in the fintech industry. We are disrupting a typically stagnant environment by connecting companies of all sizes and providing them with the platform and network needed to create value from old processes like procurement, invoicing, payments, and workflow. We recognize that business is both messy and social - two revelations that have driven the development of Tradeshift, a platform for all your business interactions. We work hard and our teams have great freedom and responsibility to choose the best solutions, technologies and approaches to evolve the product to the next level.
We believe that being a global, multicultural company is a tremendous strength and we have people working from 18 different countries with hubs in Bucharest, Copenhagen, Kuala Lumpur, and San Francisco. We believe that if we truly focus on how to work distributed and collaborate across locations and (home) offices, we will not only enjoy work more but also build better products for our customers, and ultimately be a better company.
About The Team
In the Tradeshift Data and Machine Learning team we provide solutions and services to enable, scale and automate all five key products in the Tradeshift suite, using the world’s largest business network and a distributed, microservice based, cloud native system.
Our team is primarily located in Copenhagen, with a small constituent in Bucharest. We build the data pipelines that drive both internal and customer-facing analyses, reports, and artificial intelligence. We build and maintain several backend microservices and a small set of front end applications. Our insights and algorithms feed directly into products; they also act as the bridge between our products. For instance, machine learning models identify and correct inconsistencies found in data that we are receiving from customers. Robust, fast, and accurate data pipelines are the backbone of this critical work.
About The Role
Tradeshift is looking for a superstar to join Tradeshift as a data engineer. This means being confident in creating and owning end-to-end data pipelines and ensuring availability; collaborating with experienced colleagues, mentoring less experienced ones, and helping us find our technical direction; representing Tradeshift in relevant open source communities; and primarily getting your hands dirty with code contributions for the strong team you will be part of, as well as for company wide projects.

Job Description

Take responsibility and ownership for critical data pipelines, assist with overall technical roadmap and vision for the services in the area, advising and discussing with teams that are building services (including your own) to ensure coherence and direction.
Learn and share your knowledge and expertise widely in Tradeshift, inspiring and mentoring colleagues in Engineering while always improving your expertise.
Represent Tradeshift with customers and our suppliers, and potentially with relevant open source communities.
Work with the data engineering team and product managers in a global environment to define and ship new products, migrate existing legacy code to microservices, create new services and modules within the platform and work on feature requests and improvements.
Interact with IaaS cloud providers, primarily AWS, but also GCP.
Write high-quality, tested and peer-reviewed code covered by unit, component and integration tests.
Work with technologies and tools such as Spark, Scala, PostgreSQL, Python, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka.
Perform CI/CD and orchestration tasks using Jenkins, Argo, AWS data pipelines, GitHub Actions, and Cronjobs.
Further technologies we use:
Zeppelin, RabbitMQ, Datadog, Elasticsearch, Datadog, Sentry, Splunk.

Qualifications

Have a BS/MS in Computer Science or equivalent. At least 2 years of proven data engineering experience building and maintaining systems.
Are well versed in most of these aspects of software development: Inception, architecture, design, specification, development, testing, building/deploying, running, refactoring, decommissioning, etc.
Have experience with distributed, cloud native, microservice based, major scale, transactional systems. Or the ability to apply other veins of experience and theoretical knowledge to this domain in a convincing manner.
Can primarily work in Scala, Postgresql, Python, and Java. Experience with multiple programming languages, paradigms, environments and frameworks is expected.The ability to reflect on the advantages and shortcomings in applying them to different problems and situations is key.
Thrive with hard challenges and with diving into unknown territory. Enjoy pragmatic problem solving in a collaborative environment, where the focus is on results, not individual contributions or egos.
Exhibit strong communication both with peers, senior engineers, and less experienced engineers, and people from other areas of the business. Not afraid to share knowledge, take the lead and show direction.
Are experienced and opinionated on different software development methodologies, including Scrum. Reflects on when to use what techniques, and applies them in a pragmatic manner.

In this way, we help property owners, ensure the best experience for car drivers, and most important of all, give space back to the city!
To do all that, we need to be on top of our game, developing and reinventing ourselves to achieve our bold mission; accelerate and lead the digitalisation of the parking industry!
We are ParkBee
With our roots in Amsterdam and offices in the Netherlands and the UK, we have laid the foundation to conquer the rest of Europe. By partnering up with platforms like Parkmobile, Park-line and RingGo our success is spreading like wildfire. Grab the opportunity to join our movement.
How you contribute to ParkBee
Our mission is bold and challenging. As a data-driven company, ParkBee uses many kinds of data from a wide variety of different sources. As our Data Engineer you will be coding right in the heart of ParkBee. Constructing robust data pipelines and delivering processed data from various types of databases, backends, APIs, platforms, and so on.
On top of that, you will take responsibility to plan, expand, and maintain our general data infrastructure by working with (and being supported by) our backend Dev and DevOps teams. You will have an appropriate budget, and the mandate to make your own decisions - including using third-party tools where appropriate, without needing to reinvent the wheel. Your challenge is to shape our new team and structure and direct them towards your common goals. Sounds good? Keep reading!
Is this your spot?
You love to be seen as a valued colleague, are curious about new tech, eager to solve complex problems and you thrive on the dynamics of a scaleup. You are enthusiastic about experimenting and trying out all kinds of tools and technologies.


You are driven to understand the best and cleanest way to solve a problem, whether it is the brand new implementation of a shiny tool or platform or the tried-and-tested stable choice. While this is not a DevOps position, knowledge of cloud technologies and the deployment of solutions would certainly be appreciated. For example, you might help the Data Team effectively deploy Machine Learning solutions on our existing cloud infrastructure.
Lastly, being at the heart of many interconnected systems, you must be able to work independently and coordinate efficiently with all of your tech colleagues. You are a great communicator. At the end of the day, you’ll enjoy seeing the real results of all your hard work when your data streams are being used in real analysis, and live customer-facing projects.
We are likely to be a match if you
Have a Bachelor’s degree (or higher) in any technical field; or strong evidence of experience or certification in practical engineering. On top of that, you have an additional 1 year of data engineering experience in a commercial or practical environment, ideally in a modern, agile, tech company;
Have experience with various types of SQL and NoSQL databases;
Have experience with ETL tools (FiveTran), pipelines, and related procedures;
Have experience with modern deployment tools such as Git, Docker, and Kubernetes;
Have any other relevant experience with things like parsing static datasets, connecting APIs, web analytics tools, and so on;
Have experience with Python or experience with similar languages plus a willingness to learn these;
Have basic experience with AWS and Azure, or similar cloud platforms (a plus).
Park with us!
Not only will you help reshape city parking, but you’ll also rapidly move your career forward. We offer:
Full coverage of bills, hobbies, and items on your bucket list;

Ambitious team players you don’t want to challenge with foosball (yet);

Inspiring office in Amsterdam on the same fruitful soil as leading scaleups like Amazon, Uber, and eBay (where we would love to have you around for at least 3 days a week);

Visa sponsorship and 30% ruling for internationals;

Personal development budget;

Pension plan.

Reserve your spot, drive-in later
Sounds good? We would love to hear from you! We don’t require (in fact, please don’t write) a long motivation letter; we’d rather have a few pointers, your LinkedIn (or resume), and a good chat to tell you everything you want to know. Have some burning questions first? Get in touch with Shiane via LinkedIn."

Achtergrond opdracht
Wij zijn op zoek naar een senior Data Engineer Business Intelligence als onderdeel van ons team Smart Asset Solutions
Het team werkt volgens agile/scrum/safe principes en een DevOps manier, alwaar we ook bezig zijn om daar de Biz component sterker in te maken.
Bij deze functie komt een veelvoud aan tooling aan bod. Wederom zonder uitputtend te zijn, voor BI: Spatial ETL tooling ( nog onderhanden werk ), SQL tools, Matillion Cloud ETL, Snowflake Cloud Datawarehouse en de voor de hand liggende cloud tools voor met name version management en CI/CD (Git). Vooralsnog besteden we technisch beheer van onze infrastructuur uit aan een ander team, maar daar kan zomaar verandering in komen.
Het zwaartepunt voor deze functie ligt echter op Matillion/Snowflake, maar we hebben vooralsnog ( vanwege een hoge graad aan geografische verwerkingen ) een duale datawarehouse omgeving waardoor ook Postgres/Postgis aan bod kunnen komen met een nog nader te selecteren geografisch ETL tool.

Några års relevant arbetslivserfarenhet.
Erfarenhet av att arbetat med Microsofts produkter, exempelvis Azure, Synapse och PowerBI.
Erfarenhet av att koda till exempel Python, R eller SQL.
Intresse och driv för att utveckla både organisationer och arbetsformer.
Mycket goda kunskaper i engelska, i tal såväl som skrift.
Så klart - goda IT-färdigheter, bland annat i Microsoft 365-paketet.

Att jobba på Keolis
Vi erbjuder dig att jobba i en utvecklings- och affärsorienterad bransch. Keolis är ett globalt bolag där du kommer fokusera på Keolis Sverige. Här driver vi trafik över stora delar av Sverige, för närvarande i Dalarna, Karlstad, Uppsala, Göteborg och Stockholm. För att vi ska kunna växa behöver vi bl. a kunna leverera våra tjänster med högre effektivitet och/eller kvalitet än våra konkurrenter. Det ställer stora krav på våra medarbetare samtidigt som det erbjuder ett högt fokus på utveckling där vi måste förbättras för att växa.
Vi vill ge dig de bästa förutsättningarna så att du snabbt kommer in i bolaget för att både leverera resultat och samtidigt må bra. Du som medarbetare kommer att få ett individuellt utformat introduktionsprogram för att ge dig en flygande start.
Vi erbjuder en spännande arbetsmiljö präglad av etnisk och kulturell mångfald där klimatet är öppet och vi respekterar varandra. På Keolis har du goda förutsättningar att kombinera ditt yrkesliv med privatliv och vi arbetar aktivt för att främja vår personals utveckling och växa inom företaget.

Einsame Inseln sind aus deiner Sicht ein tolles Ferienziel, haben in einer modernen Datenarchitektur jedoch nichts mehr verloren? Du bist nicht Robinson Crusoe, sondern unser nächster Toni Stark? Dann bist du bei uns genau richtig – als Team können wir mit dir die Datenwelt erobern.
Als innovatives Schweizer Software-Unternehmen realisieren wir betriebswirtschaftliche Software-Lösungen mit Abacus Business Software, der Business Intelligence-Software Qlik sowie PROVIS für namhafte Schweizer Unternehmen. Die Axept Business Software AG wurde 2006 als privates Unternehmen gegründet und verfügt heute über Geschäftsstellen in Bern-Schönbühl, Basel-Pratteln, Zürich-Kemptthal und St. Gallen mit über 160 Mitarbeitenden. Unsere Kompetenzen liegen auf den Gebieten Konzeption, Implementierung und Einführung sowie Betreuung und Weiterentwicklung von betriebswirtschaftlichen Lösungen mit Business Software – von der Beratung bis zur Umsetzung auf hohem Niveau.
Aufgaben
Das macht deinen Alltag spannend: 

Als Data Engineer übernimmst du die Verantwortung für Schnittstellenprojekte und komplexe Datentransformationen und erleichterst unseren Kunden den Arbeitsalltag durch optimal vernetzte Systeme.
Du siehst dich selbst als Pionier und übernimmst gerne den Lead - Dank dieser Persönlichkeit erarbeitest du mit unseren Kunden, externen Partnern und internen Ansprechpersonen neue Konzepte für automatisierte und optimierte Prozesse.
Mit deinen Projektleitungsskills begleitest du deine Ansprechpersonen durch den Alltag und denkst dich immer wieder in neue Prozesse ein.
Und in deinem Alltag bist du nicht alleine: Als Teil des Business Intelligence Teams bist du mitten im Geschehen. Teamspirit wird bei uns gross geschrieben.
Die Implementation der konzipierten Lösung beim Kunden machen dein Arbeitsgebiet spannend und abwechslungsreich.
Du wirst dich immer wieder in neuen Situationen und Herausforderungen wiederfinden, was dich anspornt, deinen Erfahrungsschatz stetig zu erweitern.
Auch nach der sorgfältigen und persönlichen Einführung kannst du auf die kollegiale Unterstützung deiner Kolleginnen und Kollegen zählen.

Qualifikation
Das bringst du mit: 

Spass und Motivation – wir erwarten von dir noch keine Überfliegerqualitäten. Du solltest aber den Mut aufbringen können, dich kämpferisch und auch selbständig durch neue Situationen zu bringen. Wichtig ist auch, dass du ein gutes Verständnis an betriebswirtschaftlichen Zusammenhängen und Datenstrukturen mitbringst, damit du den Kunden und sein Business verstehst.
Weiter wünschen wir uns von dir ein ausgeprägtes analytisches Denken und Begeisterung für Datenstrukturen.
Was wir uns in deinem Bildungsrucksack vorstellen? Gar nicht so einfach, viele Wege führen zu uns. Erfolgversprechend sind sicher eine technische oder kaufmännische Ausbildung ergänzt mit einer abgeschlossenen Weiterbildung im Bereich Wirtschaftsinformatik oder Informatik. Deine Berufserfahrungen im Bereich Data Engineering werden dir im Alltag zugutekommen.
Deine SQL-Kenntnisse hast du einsatzbereit und vorteilsweise kannst du dich noch mit weiteren Programmierkenntnissen um die Ohren schlagen.
Deine Kolleginnen und Kollegen freuen sich auf Verstärkung von einer unkomplizierten, humorvollen Person. Und ja, es wartet richtig viel Büez auf dich. «Gring ache u seckle» sollte dir nicht fremd sein.

Benefits
Und das hast du dann davon: 

Einen anspruchsvollen, aber superspannenden Job, in den wir dich vor Ort gut einarbeiten. Und wenn du sattelfest bist, gute Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten.
Es ist uns ein wenig peinlich, uns für den vermutlich besten Teamspirit weit und breit selber zu rühmen. Darum zitieren wir hier einfach ein fünf Sterne-Feedback von Kununu:

«Teamspirit wird gross geschrieben». Stimmt!

Von null auf hundert in 15… nein, nicht Sekunden, Jahren. Wir sind schnell, aber gesund gewachsen und gut organisiert. Doch etwas ist noch wie in unseren Anfängen: Die Strukturen sind schlank und du findest die richtigen Ansprechpartner leicht.
In unserem Bereich gehören wir zu den grösseren Playern und sind bekannt für unsere hohe Qualität. Kein Wunder, werden wir immer wieder als herausragend guter Umsetzungspartner ausgezeichnet.
Einen guten Lohn, den du mit deiner Leistung mitbestimmen kannst. Krankentaggeld- und Unfallversicherung? Übernehmen wir. Zusammen mit anderen Benefits macht das schnell einmal ein paar Tausender im Jahr aus.

Wir hätten noch viel mehr zu erzählen. Was Deinen Job bei uns sonst noch spannend macht zum Beispiel. Wer wir sind und wie wir so ticken. Deshalb zögere nicht und mach Dir Dein eigenes Bild.
Schon Feuer gefangen?Du willst lieber schon heute als morgen loslegen? Dann her mit deinem CV oder dem Link auf dein LinkedIn-Profil. Das Motivationsschreiben kannst du dir sparen, wir sind auch da völlig unkompliziert.
Und das (a) im Stellentitel?
Es ist unser Statement für Vielfalt. Wir stehen auf durchmischte Teams. Alter, Herkunft, Hautfarbe oder Geschlecht sind uns egal. Bei uns sind (a)lle willkommen, die uns mit ihrem Talent weiterbringen.

About OakNorth


     Small and medium-size enterprises (SME) are one of the biggest drivers of growth and innovation in economies all over the world. Despite these companies being a powerful force in the economy, many SMEs find it difficult to raise capital during critical stages of their company growth. Traditional commercial lending is optimised to make loans that are either too small to be effective or too large and expensive to be practical. At OakNorth, our mission is to help lenders fill this gap which we refer to as the “Missing Middle.” We are building a SaaS platform called the Credit Intelligence Suite which transforms commercial lending by helping banks build deeper relationships with their clients, open new, more profitable opportunities, whilst delivering credit decisions up to ten times faster than traditional models, with lower risk and greater efficiency.
   


 Our Investors


     OakNorth Holdings (the group which includes OakNorth Bank plc and the various OakNorth software entities around the world) has raised over $1bn from leading investors, including: Clermont Group, Coltrane, EDBI of Singapore, GIC, NIBC, SMBC, Toscafund, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund.
   


 We have ambitious goals for this platform, and to help us realise them we’re looking for experienced software engineers who are just as focused on the product side of engineering as they are on the technical. You’ll be joining our global engineering team, which is less than 100 engineers, to make a big impact on the direction of our technology platform and most importantly, on the day-to-day workflows of our customers.
   


 Our Customers


     In addition to OakNorth’s own bank in the UK, the software is also being deployed by banks around the world, including: Capital One, Fifth Third, PNC, SMBC, Customers Bank, Old National Bank, Modern Bank, and Lafayette Square in the US, and ABN Amro, NIBC and OIMIO in Europe.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   From the cozy local wine store to the trendy sneaker pop-up, the Retail team at Square is equipping retail sellers with simple solutions to complex problems - like predictive analytics and fluid, omni-channel capabilities to meet customers wherever they are. Square’s mission is economic empowerment, and Data Scientists support this by using data to understand and empathize with our customers, thereby enabling us to build a remarkable product experience. You and your fellow data science & analytics teammates on the Retail Analytics team are embedded within product and marketing sub-teams (“squads”), leveraging data engineering, analytics, statistics, and machine learning to empower data-driven decision making in the full life cycle of product development.
 You will:

 Partner with the product, design, and marketing stakeholders to identify, prioritize, and answer the most important questions where analytics can have a material impact
 Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning; discerning where simple analytics solutions (e.g. a quick heuristic or visualization) are preferable to complex solutions (e.g. machine learning)
 Contribute to the data strategy of product engineering, influencing engineers to make well-informed architecture and design decisions that affect data at Square
 Provide comprehensive day-to-day analytics support to partner teams, developing tools and resources to empower data access and self-service so your advanced expertise can be leveraged where it is most impactful
 Lead and mentor others on medium and long-term cross-functional initiatives that span product domains




  Qualifications
   You have:

 5+ years of analytics experience and a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent
 Fluency in SQL, with experience exploring and understanding large, complex datasets & data systems
 Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers
 Experience with statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, cross-selling, clustering user archetypes, and predicting churn
 Very strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
 Proven ability to lead cross-functional projects that depend on the contributions of others in a variety of disciplines
 Experience maintaining a backlog and performing independently
 Experience with a BI tool such as Looker or Tableau


 Even better:

 An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.) in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Physical Sciences, Economics, or a related technical field
 Experience with data warehouse design, development and best practices


 Technologies we use and teach:

 SQL (Snowflake)
 Optimizely

What We Do
 Crystal is on a mission to create a professional world where people are treated like people, not numbers. Our customers use our DISC-based AI to better understand the personality and behaviors of their employees, job candidates, and sales prospects; enabling them to be more effective and empathetic communicators, managers, and salespeople. We’re currently looking to grow our product delivery team in order to keep building the largest and most accurate personality platform in the world.
 Who We Are

We’re a fully-remote team of 20+ people, located across the continental US.
As a personality-based company, we know that people are unique and that our differences make us stronger. Because of that we support and seek to build teams that are diverse across all aspects of identity, perspective, and personality.
Among other things, we value: 
    
Providing full trust with ownership and responsibility over your work.
Staying focused on our great opportunities by intentionally saying “no” to a lot of good opportunities.
A constant culture of healthy feedback - from each other and from our customers.
Taking our work seriously, but not taking ourselves too seriously.
Maintaining a healthy product by continuously evaluating and addressing technical debt.

We have thousands of users and customers globally, including professionals from 90% of Fortune 500 companies!
We’ve raised $7MM in early-stage VC funding, led by Salesforce Ventures.

What You’d Do

Work to improve, maintain, monitor, and expand upon the AI that drives our personality predictions and insights.
Play a key role in upcoming projects as we seek to expand the data and sources available to our prediction engine.
Guide data-backed thinking about our product and help generate the insights we'll need to help our customers more effectively.
Help us develop A/B (and/or other multivariate) testing strategies so we can safely accelerate the pace of our Product Delivery organization.
As an early member of a small team, help us build culture, best practices, and architecture that will support us and our customers as we grow.
Consult on the development of a very early-stage business intelligence/reporting infrastructure to help the leadership team understand and drive the business from a data-driven perspective.

What You’d Earn

Base salary in the range of $100,000 to $140,000 annually.
An equity grant in the form of stock options (specifically, ISOs).
4 weeks of paid time off.
Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance contributions for you and any dependents.
Regular opportunities to meet in-person with your team and with the whole company for team-building and strategy.
Assistance with setting up a home office as necessary.
Participation in our company book club - we’ll buy books for you and reward you for reading them!

You Should Apply If…

You have the equivalent of 4+ years of experience in the data science/analysis field. This is not an entry-level position - we need someone who can come help us bootstrap a great product data discipline with minimal oversight.
You have strong communication skills, particularly in written English. As a remote team, asynchronous (written) communication is paramount to our success - especially when it comes to explaining complex and/or technical ideas.
You have experience working with data querying languages (such as SQL) and data scripting languages (like Python, R, etc.).
You are familiar with best practices and methods for training and maintaining an artificial intelligence (AI) model.
Knowledge and experience with any of the following would be a huge plus: 
    
Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially sentiment/emotion analysis
Predictive Modeling, especially if you're familiar with statistical methods for validating the output of such a model
Multivariate (especially A/B) testing in a SaaS product

You’re interested in being part of a product delivery team - we are all passionate and invested in what we are building, and enjoy collaborating with each other and our stakeholders to make our product better.

  Job Description
   We're looking for a Senior Data Scientist to join our team as we turn Shop into one of the most beloved products and brands in the world. We want shoppers to be able to develop meaningful connections with the brands they love, and we believe that Shop is the answer to helping foster those relationships with the powerhouse of Shopify merchants we love and support.
 Data is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success.
 Our Data Scientists focus on pushing products and the business forward, with a focus on solving important problems rather than specific tools. We are looking for talented data scientists to help us better understand our merchants and buyers so we can help them on their journey.
 Your responsibilities:

 Proactively identify and champion projects that solve complex problems across multiple domains
 Partner closely with product, engineering and other business leaders to influence product and program decisions with data
 Apply specialized skills and fundamental data science methods (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when needed) to inform improvements to our business
 Design and implement end-to-end data pipelines: work closely with stakeholders to build instrumentation and define dimensional models, tables or schemas that support business processes
 Build actionable KPIs, production-quality dashboards, informative deep dives, and scalable data products
 Influence leadership to drive more data-informed decisions
 Define and advance best practices within data science and product teams

 Qualifications
   You will need to have:

 4-6 years of commercial experience as a Data Scientist solving high impact business problems
 Extensive experience with Python and software engineering fundamentals
 Experience with applied statistics and quantitative modelling (e.g. regression, survival analysis, segmentation, experimentation, and machine learning when needed)
 Demonstrated ability to translate analytical insights into clear recommendations and effectively communicate them to technical and non-technical stakeholders
 Curiosity about the problem domain and an analytical approach
 Strong sense of ownership and growth mindset

 It would be nice if you have:

 Deep understanding of advanced SQL techniques
 Expertise with statistical techniques and their applications in business
 Masterful data storytelling and strategic thinking
 Deep understanding of dimensional modelling and scaling ETL pipelines
 Experience launching productionized machine learning models at scale
 Extensive domain experience in e-commerce, marketing or SaaS

 Additional Information
   All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.

Project Description: 
Our vision is to realize the potential of the animals we live with. We are looking for enthusiastic and committed people to join us in this pursuit. We are studying tools for teaching non-human animals how to express themselves using sound buttons.   Fellowship Description: 
We are looking for curious, research-oriented fellows able to help us develop, analyze and innovate research on how animals express themselves using sound buttons. While fellows will be employed by CleverPet, makers of FluentPet, their primary role will be in supporting the current research as part of the How.TheyCanTalk.org (http://how.theycantalk.org/) Research Initiative, which is a combination of an open research project and online community.
Accepted research fellows will engage directly with the animal communication research being performed. Depending on the fellowship's focus, this will involve a combination of data organization and management, data analysis, and literature review, among other tasks. Fellows will be supervised by and engage directly with members of the How.TheyCanTalk.org (http://how.theycantalk.org/) and CleverPet leadership teams.
The data we are collecting and organizing in the How.TheyCanTalk Research Initiative will be shared with the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at UC San Diego, and thus this fellowship will provide avenues for potential scholarly collaboration and publication development. We expect such collaborations to help fellows advance their careers, academic or otherwise.
 Data Scientist/ Statistician:
Description:
This role will assist in the organization and analysis of an existing dataset on button pressing and associated behaviors by non-human animals (e.g., dogs and cats). In this role, you will be engaged in organizing, cleaning, and analyzing existing datasets to test hypotheses about animal cognition and behavior, as well as generating and testing language models. Any work conducted as part of this fellowship must abide by principles of open science, and interns will be encouraged to pre-register their analyses and deposit both their datasets and code as part of the publication process.
Requirements:

Advanced training in Bayesian statistical analyses using R and Stan
 Experience with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and mixed-effects models
 Familiarity with R Markdown and GitHub are advantageous
 Facility with organizing large data sets, with attention to detail
 Experience with research design and analysis
 Experience with pre-registration is a plus
 Experience in cognitive science, linguistics, comparative psychology, evolutionary psychology, animal behavior, neuroscience, and related domains is a plus.
 A commitment to open, transparent, and reproducible science

 Timeline and compensation:
Our proposed fellowships are for 12 weeks this summer and are open to all qualified, interested, and motivated students. These fellowships are entirely remote and will come with compensation of $7,500 for the duration of the anticipated 12 weeks. Funding is guaranteed for all accepted students. Any required travel will be reimbursed.
The suggested start date is June 6th, although this can be adjusted to match fellows' availability. In May, we will review applications between May 2nd and May 20th.

About Murmuration/What We Do

 Murmuration is a political strategy organization that is transforming the politics of education so that every child can benefit from equal access to equitable and high-quality public schools.

 We empower campaigns, advocates, and organizers to better engage and mobilize communities to demand improvements to the public education system. We advise and support our partners in their efforts to plan and execute successful, data-driven electoral, organizing, and advocacy campaigns so that together we can transform the politics of education. And we build political influence, craft strategies, leverage data, and develop technology that enable our partners to accelerate progress, particularly those in traditionally marginalized communities.

 Who We Are

 Our team includes experts and innovators in data, analytics, and strategy. We are former teachers, organizers, data scientists, nonprofit executives, political campaign veterans, and more - and we are looking for people whose passion and expertise can help improve our work and realize our vision.

 Background

 Murmuration’s role is to support organizations and communities through our political systems, to raise the profile of the issue of public education such that more Americans will prioritize the needs of our students, and to leverage politics to help to create the broader context in which those on the front lines with our children can thrive. We are focused on transforming the politics of education—partnering with organizations across the country committed to organizing parents and communities around the issues of public education and educational equity, electing to office and holding accountable local leaders who will make improving public K-12 schools a priority, and advocating for policy changes with the goal of improving outcomes for children. To do this, we believe that it is critical that all of the political stakeholders—electoral organizations, advocacy and organizing groups, charter associations, networks of schools, districts, elected officials, and voters—contribute to a strong and politically savvy education sector that works together toward a common vision of improving public education.

 About the Position


 We are looking for a creative and endlessly inquisitive Data Scientist to join our team. You are flexible and eager to contribute to a highly collaborative team. You will be working hand-in-hand with the Partnerships team and all of our Data Scientists to develop highly optimized predictive models from a large volume of regularly updated data and to design experiments to test the effectiveness of various campaign tactics. In addition, you will be a key resource for building out custom analytics to help analyze our partners’ work in the political organizing and advocacy spheres. You will be working in a small but dedicated, detail-oriented team that is committed to our mission. The Murmuration work environment is friendly, impact-driven, and highly collaborative.


 Note: At Murmuration, we are committed to becoming an even more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. To this end, all staff members are expected to sit on and actively participate in DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) subcommittees. These subcommittees work to ensure that DEI is embedded in everything we do.

 Key Responsibilities


 Provide analytic insights and deliver data science products for our partners throughout the lifecycle of their campaign(s) by building and recommending custom models, providing analysis of campaign work, and producing post-campaign analytics to help our partners constantly learn from their efforts;
Identify gaps in internal and external products that Data Science can help to build, and work cross-functionally to design, contribute, and/or lead the build of these products;
Create predictive models using the latest machine learning algorithms on relatively “big” data;
Explore data sets for insights that can help drive product improvements and feature prioritization;
Contribute to the expansion and refinement of Murmuration proprietary codebase;
Design and implement large-scale randomized controlled trials to gauge the general effectiveness of advocacy and campaign efforts;
Learn to work collaboratively in a technical environment with the goal of building tools that are constantly evolving based on our needs; and
Work closely with our partnerships team to identify and develop practical ways to apply our leading analytics to our partners’ problems.



 Who You Are

 The ideal candidate will have:

An educational background and/or experience in political science, computer science, economics, mathematics, statistics or other related field (preferred);
3-4 years of work experience as a Data Scientist or data analyst, or a Master’s degree, or equivalent, in Data Science;
Strong basic data science skills (data cleaning, munging, data analysis, and data visualization);
Experience with scripting and general purpose programming languages (SQL, Python, or R);
Experience data mining large datasets (familiarity with voterfile or Census data is a plus);
Experience building and deploying machine learning models;
Strong understanding of basic statistical techniques and how to apply them to a variety of real-world datasets;
Strong problem-solving skills as well as the ability to effectively communicate findings and recommendations to non-technical audiences; and
Interest in politics and/or educational policy.



 Location, Compensation and Benefits

 The Data Scientist is a full-time, salaried position with a comprehensive benefits package. It is based anywhere in the U.S. with location preferred in New York City. Minimum salary for this position is $120,000 but is commensurate with experience.

How We Work
Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. If you are in the Bay Area, you can drop by our San Francisco office on 2nd and Market St. We are able to hire across the United States and Canada and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this 'sync time' is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline once a year between Christmas and New Year (and twice during the Pandemic). Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

Perks at Loom
Competitive compensation and equity package

  Company Description
   As the industry leader in compensation management, Payscale is on a mission to help job seekers, employees and businesses get pay right, and make sustainable fair pay a reality. Empowering more than 53 percent of the Fortune 500 in 198 countries, Payscale provides a combination of data-driven insights, best-in-class services and innovative software to enable organizations such as Angel City Football Club, Perry Ellis International, United Healthcare, Vista and The Washington Post to make fair and appropriate pay decisions. Pay is powerful. To learn more, visit www.payscale.com



  Job Description
   What We Do: The Data Science Team focuses on building models that leverage Payscale’s five core compensation datasets to provide accurate, high coverage estimates of compensation ranges for jobs across industries and the globe. We use modeling techniques such as Bayesian linear regression, hierarchical modeling, transfer learning, NLP, and embeddings to model how different jobs are related to each other in order to produce good compensation range predictions. We do a mix of development on well-defined projects and greenfield innovation on our own ideas. We build internal tools (APIs and interactive demos (using e.g. streamlit)) to exhibit our work. We value teamwork, learning together, maintainability, documentation, and giving clear presentations about our work to non-ML stakeholders. We are generalist problem solvers—we use (or learn!) the best tool for the problem. Our team is remote with some team members working out of offices in Seattle, WA and Burlington, MA periodically.
 Our team works closely with compensation domain experts to help define the problems, identify and validate our assumptions, and evaluate our predictions. We are supported by a separate Data Engineering Team that helps turn our models into production APIs for use in products across Payscale’s portfolio.
 What You Do: You will be designing and building machine learning models that provide compensation estimates in low-data scenarios, allow us to quantitatively compare jobs to each other (embeddings, NLP), and quantify the impact that skills and other compensable factors have on pay across jobs, industries, and locations. You’ll interface with domain experts and software engineers on a regular basis. You’ll give periodic presentations about your models/findings to a technical, but not-ML-trained audience. Our codebase is in Python, with some Pytorch and Tensorflow.
 Day-in-the-Life:
 As a Data Scientist II, a typical day may include the following:

 Designing and building a new model

Job Title: Data Scientist
Type of Contract: Consultant
Division: RAM/RAMAH – Research, Assessment and Monitoring Division – Hunger Monitoring Unit
Duty Station (City, Country): HQ Rome, Italy

Duration: 11 months (with possibility of renewal)

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT:
The Hunger Monitoring Unit (RAMAH) in WFP’s Research Assessment and Monitoring (RAM) Division manages WFP’s global hunger monitoring systems, building upon the successes of the mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) initiative. This entails the establishment and oversight of WFP’s near real-time food security and nutrition monitoring systems in close to 40 countries, as well as developing and refining advanced analytical approaches for nowcasting and forecasting food security indicators using predictive analytics in collaboration with internal and external partners to general timely information on global food security. Data from these systems flows into the HungerMap LIVE (hungermap.wfp.org), WFP’s global hunger monitoring system. This information is also published through Global and Regional Insights and Key Trends reports and other related resources, enabling decision makers to monitor the situation effectively and adopt early mitigation actions.
The Hunger Monitoring Unit in the RAM division is collaborating with WFP Nutrition Division and the WFP Innovation Accelerator (INKA) in Munich on a project to generate and increase access to modeled data on risk of dietary Vitamin and Mineral Deficiency (VMD) at national and sub-national levels, which will be critical to inform the design and roll-out of large-scale food fortification as well as complementary programs to control micronutrient deficiencies. This project will contribute towards the improvement of core Large-Scale Food Fortification (LSFF) program performance metrics, and in conjunction with the Micronutrient Forum (MNF) Data Alliance, will achieve consensus on approach, including the proxy indicator(s) for risk of dietary VMDs, the design of and data underlying subnational maps, and use of modeling, that will translate to clear and consistent programmatic guidance. Specifically, the objective of the project is to develop a composite proxy-indicator for risk of inadequate dietary micronutrient intake and integrate it with in the HungerMapLIVE systems and related products.
The expansion of the HungerMapLIVE to include a data layer on risk of dietary vitamin and mineral deficiencies and the potential of different programs, including LSFF, to fill nutrient gaps has been identified as an opportunity to support programme and policy decision-makers from national governments and other stakeholders. This activity will bring together the analytical and government technical assistance expertise of the Analytics and Science for Food and Nutrition (AS4FN) team, data collection and visualization experience from the Hunger Monitoring Team and WFP Innovation Accelerator’s (INKA) digital innovation and project accelerator capacities.
For this project, the Hunger Monitoring Unit seeks a Data Scientist Consultant to work with the project team on the development of the methodology for accessing the risk of dietary VMD and support the integration in HungerMap LIVE.

ACCOUNTABILITIES/RESPONSIBILITIES:
The Consultant will be responsible for the following activities:
Support the design and implementation of the models and methodology for estimating risk of dietary VMD at national and sub-national level
Support the team in mapping data and indicators relevant to the construction of a composite proxy indicator for dietary VMD risks and data collation
Conduct ad-hoc data explorations and analysis for the project, by means of traditional statistical analysis as well as state-of-the-art data science methodologies
Present project specific analytical methods and findings to and participate in technical-level discussions with Scientific Committee members and analytical partners
In collaboration with the software engineering team in Hunger Monitoring Unit, design and implement production-ready data pipelines for visualizing the data in the HungerMapLIVE

Job Posting 22-Apr-2022, 11:02:52 AM
The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation, made up of approximately 4,000 people – each committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.

Risk management in its broadest sense is at the core of the Bank's mission and is central to everything we do. As well as the diverse policy risks managed by the Bank's three policymaking committees, the Bank is also exposed to a wide array of financial and non-financial risks.

The Risk Directorate was created following the 2018 internal Risk Governance Review and houses the second line of defence risk and compliance functions charged with providing effective oversight of the Bank’s financial and non-financial risks and ensuring compliance with its policies. The Directorate brought together various second line functions – Bankwide Risk, Financial Risk & Resilience, and the Bank’s central Compliance Division, including Privacy. The Risk Directorate also includes Business Continuity Management.
Internal Audit forms the third line of Defence for the bank and is part of the Risk Directorate for administration purposes but operates independently

Department Overview

In the data team how you achieve your task is 100% over to you: no one is going to be prescribing exactly what to do, or exactly how to do it (although you’ll have a strong network of experienced Data Scientists to help you out!). To be successful you’ll need to innovate, chat with key stakeholders, and read up on best practices in order to identify and implement the most appropriate data-led solution (see ‘ongoing projects’ below to see the exciting projects the current team are working on!)
You will find the data team regularly using SQL, Python, GA, Elasticsearch and BigQuery; as well as Jira and GSheets for project management. Depending on the challenge at hand, we also use Tableau for in-depth visualisations, and big data technologies to implement machine learning solutions that Python can’t handle. Don’t worry if you’ve not used all these techs before - we’re not necessarily looking for someone with lots of experience with these languages specifically, it’s an insatiable curiosity and innate ability to think logically that we’re most interested in.
 Ongoing projects:

Leveraging our recommendation systems to preempt customer need and email them the teaching resources they need for the coming week, before they know they need them.
Continuous collaboration with the conversion rate optimisation team to test and improve all touchpoints of the user experience in a data led progression.
Blending traditional search engine logic (think TF-IDF) with cutting edge machine techniques in order to provide the best possible search experience.
Using a hybrid collaborative-filtering approach to show the most relevant resource page recommendations on each of our 500 000 resource pages.
Engineering data pipelines that analyse customer need in real-time to automatically flag (and address!) gaps in our product offering as soon as they arise.
Visit our Data Science Blog to find out more 

To succeed in the role, you will:

Have a strong analytical mindset and relentless attention to detail.
Have the ability to see projects through from conception to delivery, bringing actionable insight to bear.
Have the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts that can be actioned step by step.
Have excellent communication skills, including being able to explain complicated concepts in layman’s terms.
Be able to identify viable business opportunities that can be actioned using data

In this role, you will have the opportunity to:

 Compose complex queries; pulling the information you need from our huge data sets (the biggest of which has more than a trillion data points!)
Implement machine learning techniques using a flexible variety of tooling and programming languages.
Work closely with senior leaders, experienced data scientists and a range of others across all levels of the organisation; partnering with them to deliver concrete results on a data led project. 
Attend in-house bi weekly training sessions, covering a range of key technical and soft skills
Apply for one of our fully funded spaces on the part-time Developer Academy Data Science course (usually costs £5000)

You’ll work with:

George Mulroy (Head of Data) - George started his career as an infant school teacher before retraining as a Data Scientist (Sheffield Uni Data Science MSc). George now works as Twinkl’s Head of Data, as well as doing occasional contract Data Science Consultancy work. 
Thomas Gibbs - leading our Key Algorithms team
Leopold Price - leading our Projects team
Ryan Borthwick - leading our Data Reporting team

Requirements
 We're interested in anyone who meets the following criteria:

Is excited and passionate about Twinkl’s mission
Holds a degree (or equivalent) in a quantitative field (e.g. Maths, Computer Science, etc)
Has 1+ years employed in a role with an analytical focus, including a clear track record of adding value
Experience of programming in SQL or Python
Has experience in, or can demonstrate a keen interest in learning machine learning techniques

Our mission is to change the way the world works by democratizing AI for every business, and to build a great company – that everyone loves being a part of. These two goals haven't changed since the days when Peak was little more than an idea forming in the heads of our founders Richard, Atul and Dave.

We've launched a brand new software category, Decision Intelligence, which we want to spearhead and become the trusted, global voice of.

We're opening up the Peak platform to more organizations, empowering businesses to now build their own Decision Intelligence solutions and applications for the very first time.

All of this means that we're expanding our team rapidly, with huge growth plans in place. But we know that culture and success come hand in hand, so creating and protecting an amazing company culture that's true to our values remains really important to Peak and our mission.

Job Description:
We are looking for a talented and creative Product Data Scientist interested in building, defining and pushing the boundaries of game analytics and AB test analysis for live games in Candy Crush Jelly. You’ll have a proven ability to apply your skills, be it technical, behavioral or economic, in order to generate value for the mobile games you’ll be working on.
Your Role
You’ll help us to further understand, segment, predict and retain our players. You will be part of a cross- functional team of other data scientists, product managers, game designers and developers, and you’ll be tasked to drive the analytical side of the game, collaborating with the broader group.
Specifically, you’ll:
Design, monitor, analyze and communicate results for AB tests
Translate business needs to technical and AB test requirements, then work with development teams to ensure correct implementation and event tracking
Work closely with game designers and product team to scope and design tests to identify potential opportunities (e.g. player behavior, game economy)
Proactively develop new analyses, experiments and data- driven tools to harness business opportunities
Carefully check and problem solve issues to ensure the correct operations of the game, even when confronted by subtle data complications
Provide a business analytical perspective to discussions and help to drive the priorities within your game
Champion data literacy within the cross- functional game team, and share your knowledge with the wider Data Science community

Required Skills
You have a passion for quantitative analysis, understanding player behaviour and will have the ability to draw business insights which will add real value to King. You are able to learn quickly and have worked in a fast- paced and collaborative environment. This role will involve working with teams and individuals across King - such as Game Developers, Producers and Game Artists, so broad communication skills are essential.
You need to be proficient in the following key skills:
Product insight: You are capable of using data to gain deep understanding of game mechanics and impacts on player behavior to solve business problems such as: feature implementation and optimizations, player economy optimization, main KPI shift, tracking bugs, marketing impact.
Data Storytelling: You understand how to communicate, visualize and report your findings in a clear and unambiguous way to people with diverse degrees of numerical proficiency.
Technical skills: You can extract, manipulate and visualize the data and you have an understanding of applied statistics (probability, causality and time series). We make intensive usage of SQL, cloud services and the Python/R analytical stack, so having prior experience in at least two of these domains is definitely a plus.
There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in the areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.
Specific prior experience that might be helpful, but is not required, includes:
Experience in the games industry or customer- facing digital businesses
Behavioral psychology/economics/game theory
Working knowledge of randomized controlled trials (ex: social science research, medical research, biostatistics, policy research etc.) or digital A/B testing and online controlled experiments
Experience with an experimentation platform or with conversion rate optimization (CRO) for Apps
Software engineering skills
Standard reporting tools such as Looker/Tableau/etc.
Cloud- based big data solutions such as Redshift, BigQuery

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

 You will:

 Partner with the product, design, and marketing stakeholders to identify, prioritize, and answer the most important questions where analytics can have a material impact
 Apply a diverse set of tactics such as statistics, quantitative reasoning, and machine learning; discerning where simple analytics solutions (e.g. a quick heuristic or visualization) are preferable to complex solutions (e.g. machine learning)
 Contribute to the data strategy of product engineering, influencing engineers to make well-informed architecture and design decisions that affect data at Square
 Provide comprehensive day-to-day analytics support to partner teams, developing tools and resources to empower data access and self-service so your advanced expertise can be leveraged where it is most impactful




  Qualifications
   You have:

 2+ years of analytics experience
 Fluency in SQL, with experience exploring and understanding large, complex datasets & data systems
 Experience working with technical and non-technical partners, such as product managers and product marketing managers
 Experience with statistical and machine-learning techniques to solve practical business problems such as hypothesis testing, clustering user archetypes, or predicting churn
 Very strong communication skills: ability to clearly communicate complex results to technical and non-technical audiences in verbal, visual, and written media
 Experience maintaining a backlog and performing independently

EIVEE aims to simplify the procurement decision-making process and make procurement shine! To achieve this, we target emissions as well as costs, knowing that Procurement plays a key role in driving sustainability change. Because without transparency into what you buy and from where, how would you know how much that product or service emits? Our mission is to offer a state-of-the-art product that provides businesses with overview of their climate influence, cost transparency and automated expert insights, and we do this through a new and unique SaaS-like business development platform. The EIVEE product has worldwide relevance and is aimed towards companies with revenues from 50 million EUR and all the way up to the largest enterprises. With so many businesses that may benefit from our help, our market size is almost unlimited, and our growth potential enormous – which is why we are looking to expand our motivated team in Copenhagen.
Each day we see organizations struggle to navigate due to low-quality cost data and the hazzle of carbon accounting. As a result, EIVEE has developed a platform that helps businesses to reach higher level of competitiveness through cost and emission transparency and identification of optimization opportunities. The core of the platform is the business transactions (external spend) between companies - a monumental source to competitiveness, as external spend typically represents 50-70% of company costs. EIVEE’s value proposition, in short, is enablement of additional 5%+ cost reductions as well as freeing up business intelligence resources. This value proposition is further strengthened by our new Sustainable Procurement product that gives our customers the ability to track their activities’ influence on the climate and support businesses in engaging their own organization and suppliers towards a low carbon transition. With our in-depth knowledge of our customers’ procurement data, we stand in a unique position to design value creating and change-driven services and products, that helps our client in achieving a more sustainable business.

We follow an ambitious growth plan and employ a broad team of fun and ambitious people within software development, product (procurement and sustainability), sales, marketing, and financing.
What you will do

Develop applications that utilize machine learning and statistics for our procurement and sustainability products.
Implement, train and test appropriate machine learning models based on the applications to be developed.
Operationalize the applications such that they work jointly together with the rest of our tech stack, for example by means of developing an API.

Who you are

Great reasons to apply

We are looking for passionate people to join our team, ready to bring the transportation revolution to the world. Exciting times, with exciting challenges.

So, are you ready to beat the streets?

If you are someone that wants to be part of a group of entrepreneurial people who share a revolutionary mindset and work at a fun office, keep reading!

Here is the challenge

In the Data & Analytics team, the mode of operation is characterized by plenty of experimentation, a short time to market and end-to-end responsibility from the first exploratory analysis to management of production pipelines. This is achieved by efficient cooperation between a motivated group of Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

As the Lead Data Scientist at felyx, you manage a team of talented Data Scientists that is responsible for development and maintenance of our machine learning applications. These applications include time series models, classification models, vehicle routing algorithms and computer vision tasks. The variety of models and techniques makes the job challenging but very rewarding in terms of professional development. A data driven way of working is truly in the felyx DNA so expect plenty of interaction with other departments on the performance of your models.

What you’ll be doing at felyx:
Develop new machine learning applications that improve our product, increase operational efficiencies and contribute to the growth of our customer base
Improve existing machine learning applications by continuous retraining and invest in the robustness of our machine learning pipelines
Act as the main point of contact for senior management with respect to the data science roadmap and strategic plan
People management and coaching of team members
Drive the implementation of the new tools and techniques within the team, while always keeping the needs of business users and stakeholders in mind
Communication at all levels: change management for business users by conveying complex topics into easy-to-understand messages; host internal presentations and knowledge sharing sessions; present to and secure approval from senior management and other key stakeholders

And important not to forget: we encourage you to grow with the company and within your role as we are continuing on our journey towards world domination. Just kidding, market leader in Europe will do (for now).
When are you perfect for the job:
Have a proven track record in turning machine learning models into end user applications
Have an academic degree in Data Science, Operations Research, AI, Computer Science, Econometrics, Mathematics or a similar field
Have at least 2 years of experience leading a team (team- or project management experience)[AK1]

Know how to translate the outcomes of Machine Learning models into actionable insights for business stakeholders
Have extensive experience with the most common Machine Learning frameworks in python
Are comfortable with SQL, Docker and bash scripting

Bonus points if you:
Have experience in working with geospatial data or machine learning models in a mobility context
Have deployed machine learning pipelines on GCP
Enjoy riding a felyx

Benefits for you:

You will work in a transparent, fast-growing and inspirational environment in which you are able to take the lead over your own career and will get challenged on a daily basis!
And next to that:
29 paid days off on a full-time basis: 28 on the roll and a day off on your birthday! (yay!)
You will get free felyx minutes, of course.
We want to invest in your future: a good pension plan is therefore in place (1/3 employee, 2/3 employer).
We offer 6 weeks of paternity leave with 100% salary for all (upcoming) dads.
Great office with great food options, just 10 minutes from Amstel Station.
One more thing: Don’t worry about buying a suit just yet, our interview process will be online or by phone, and the office dressing code is: be comfortable and come as you are!
Okay, one last thing: In case you are doubting if you meet all the requirements, still apply! We love people and we don’t hire based only on words and cv documents.
And, if you might know someone who fits the requirements better, don’t be afraid to share it with them! We have a variety of openings and you might both end up working at Felyx. If you are a smart person and are excited about the company, you will most likely find a place here.

At felyx we believe that the best workplace is one that represents the world we live in today. This means we believe that diversity in the broadest sense of the word connects us and drives us forward as a company.
We believe that diversity goes hand in hand with different perspectives. It is these different perspectives that can help us become better and more innovative in finding solutions for our customers.
And because we believe this can be achieved, we are looking for colleagues who are intrinsically motivated and bring the right experience. Gender, age, sexual orientation or origin will never be a factor and will never become one."
