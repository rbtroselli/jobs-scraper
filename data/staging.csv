Faire les choses, ça veut dire bien les faire, ou rien. Ça te motive de savoir que tout le monde excelle autour de toi.
Passion : Geek est un compliment, tu as du plaisir à voir sortir de la machine des applications. En tant qu’utilisateur, tu as une véritable intuition quant à l’ergonomie des sites et applications que tu utilises et tu en mesures toute l’importance. A l’intérieur de l’application, le code a une logique, une architecture, c’est un écosystème intelligent et tu souhaites contribuer à le rendre encore plus beau.
Ouverture : Comme nous, tu regardes le monde entier avec intérêt : tu aimes rencontrer des gens d’origines diverses, tu parles ou apprends plusieurs langues, les autres cultures sont des sources d’inspiration, tu peux ou souhaiterais voyager… Tu es ouvert aux richesses de l’autre.

UNSERE MISSION – SONNENSTROM FÜR ALLE
Die Sonne ist eine unerschöpfliche Energiequelle. Sie zu nutzen ist der Schlüssel, um die größte Herausforderung unserer Generation zu lösen: den Klimawandel. Millionen von Hauseigentümern in Europa wollen Sonnenstrom vom eigenen Dach beziehen und könnten so einen wesentlichen Teil des europäischen Strombedarfs decken. Doch für viele Menschen ist die Nutzung von Sonnenstrom heute noch zu kompliziert und aufwändig.

Unsere Mission ist es, Sonnenstrom für alle zugänglich zu machen, indem wir die Nutzung für Endkunden als erstes Unternehmen in Deutschland radikal vereinfachen. Wir betreiben und vernetzen Solaranlagen auf den Dächern unserer Kunden zu virtuellen Kraftwerken, die unsere Kunden-Community mit Sonnenstrom versorgt – ganz einfach aus der Steckdose.

Willst du zusammen mit uns eine nachhaltigere Energieversorgung für alle aufbauen und deinen Teil zum Kampf gegen den Klimawandel beitragen?"

Baggrund og fakta
Forca er en af de største udbydere af serviceydelser til pensionsselskaber, og agerer som en professionel outsourcingpartner for en række store pensionskasser og pensionsselskaber inden for fondsadministration, medlemsservice, aktuarservice samt økonomi- og regnskabsservice. Forcas kunder er store professionelle pensionsselskaber med investeringsaktiver på tilsammen mere end 680 mia. kr.
Organisation
I 2006 stod tre uafhængige pensionsselskaber og -kasser i en forretningskritisk situation. De ønskede at udvikle forretningen og opnå stordriftsfordele, så der var mere pension til den enkelte pensionsopsparer. Samtidig ville de beholde deres selvstændighed.
Heraf udsprang Forca – en fællesejet servicepartner, der håndterer alle de bagvedliggende fællesnævnere mellem selskaberne i form af service og systemer, administration, it- og forretningsudvikling.
Ved at udnytte synergierne mellem Lærernes Pension, PKA og Pædagogernes Pension har Forca formået at skabe økonomiske resultater og vækst, der kan ses på den enkelte slutkundes pensionsopsparing. Det i en grad, så Norli Pension Livsforsikring i 2016 valgte at tilslutte sig Forca-fællesskabet. Det samme gjorde Industriens Pension i 2017, hvor de outsourcede deres fondsadministration til Forca.
I dit daglige arbejde, er du tilknyttet et agilt udviklingsteam, som udover en Product Owner og Scrum Master er sammensat af udviklere og forretningseksperter på tværs af forretningen og IT.

We’re Slyp, Australia’s first and only independent fintech backed by all four major banks.
 We build solutions that are simple on the outside but complex on the inside. The type of solutions that make you wonder why they never existed before.
 Founded by former PayPal executives in 2017, Slyp has created the Smart Receipt. Set to be Australia’s new receipt standard, the Smart Receipt is sent right inside your bank app. Convenience at its finest, while taking action for our planet.
 Australia prints a whopping 1 billion meters of non-recyclable toxic paper receipts each year. But this is just the start of the problem. Paper receipts are also a missed opportunity to understand and engage shoppers’ post-purchase. 
We’re at a pivotal moment of growth. More than 13 million Aussies will have access to Smart Receipts in their bank app by the end of 2022. And we’re building even more solutions off the back of the Smart Receipt, shaping the future of data-driven in-store experiences.
 Our values – ‘the Slyp six’ – form the heart of everything we do. And they’re part of the reason we’re now 50 Slypsters strong and recently picked up a bunch of awards: Fintech Awards 2021 Australian Fintech of Year, CEO of the Year, Best Social Mission, and Best Fintech-Bank Collaboration & a Pause Fest “I wish I’d done that” award finalist.
 This is your chance to join as part of Slyp’s foundational team as we shape the future of data driven in-store experiences. 
What does a normal day look like

Build, maintain and improve Slyp’s data lake platform. This includes working with raw and optimised data formats and making the data accessible to external tooling
Build, maintain and improve a data warehouse. This includes building infrastructure, data lake integration and support for reporting and data products
Work with the data team to define data models.
Plan, scope and build data products and infrastructure.
Follow and contribute to engineering best practices.
Engage with engineering and product in planning, design, code reviews, and technical discussions.
Build data platforms and products that can cope with huge scale
Secure access to data to authorised users.
Experiment with new technologies. We're always open to solving problems utilising new thinking.

What experience or knowledge you will bring to the team

Passion about all things data and engineering.
This is not your first rodeo. You have some experience shaping Data Engineering in a start-up or the early stages of a data function before.
Highly efficient in python & SQL
Comfortable around data lake and data warehousing practices, and integration techniques
In-depth knowledge in Software Engineering, Design Patterns and Agile Software Development.
Experience with cloud-based data platforms, such as Elasticsearch, Hadoop, AWS Redshift, AWS EMR and Dynamo DB.
Experience with the CICD of data platforms.
Expertise in creating ETLs that are highly efficient and scalable.
A deep understanding of what it takes to build scalable platforms using techniques around eventual consistency, caching and monitoring.

Finally, a little on our technology 

Cloud based and AWS hosted.
We lean heavily on AWS serverless technologies such as API Gateway (including CloudFront, WAF and Shield), Lambda, Kinesis and SQS.
We store data in AWS Aurora (Postgres), DynamoDB and S3.
Our data lake is based on AWS serverless technologies such as Kinesis, Lambda, S3 and Glue.
We embrace native mobile and make it easier for our partners to integrate our SDKs.
We have traditional NodeJS services running in EKS / Kubernetes.
Our base is a mix of Javascript, Typescript, NodeJS, HTML5, CSS, React, Redux and some Angular.
We value customer data and keep security front of mind and at our core with AWS SecurityHub.

Benefits

Competitive salary + equity 
Uncapped annual leave. We dig deep when we need to, but know rest and recovery is just as important.
Giveback days.
Generous L&D program: we want you to continue to hone your craft.
Parental leave, flexible work, and the option to work from anywhere in the world for a period. 
Sweet offices, monthly (sometimes random) lunch and learns and always on team fun.

De plus en plus de décisions sont prises automatiquement par des algorithmes dans des secteurs qui impactent nos vies privées (banque, assurance, santé, éducation). La plupart des algorithmes sont des boîtes noires et il faut se poser la question de « leur explicabilité »: c'est-à-dire la capacité à faire comprendre à un individu les facteurs qui ont motivé la décision de l'algorithme [1].
Les enjeux de l'applicabilité sont multiples: 

Du point de vue technique, mieux comprendre le modèle permet d'identifier les causes d'une faible performance puis de corriger les biais et ainsi d'améliorer, parfaire sa robustesse et prévoir ses failles le modèle.
Du point de vue sociétal, l’explicabilité permet à la société de se ré-approprier cet outil (IA, Algorithme), et rendre compte aux multiples parties prenantes, externes (régulateurs, utilisateurs, partenaires) ou internes à l’organisation (managers, chefs de projet).

Octopeek pour sa part s’engage résolument dans une approche sociétale de L’IA. Son but est de faire de l’explicabilité un composant de base dans la conception de ses solutions d’apprentissage et de traitement de la data .
Vos missions
Dans ce cadre, l’objectif de ce stage est de réaliser un travail de recherche via :

Une étude bibliographique et actualisé de l’explicabilité
Identification des composants de la solution de traitement interne de données nécessitant de l’explicabilité
Evaluation de différentes approches aux travers de prototypes afin d’éléments comparatifs

Votre profil
Stagiaire bac +5 / master de dernière année
Livrables :

mémoire de recherche
Outil : prototypes d’explicabilité afin de comparer les solutions entres elles.

Aujourd’hui, les modèles de machine learning sont de plus en plus abondants. En plus de la donnée qui devient plus facile d’accès et de traitement, les use-cases de data science et d’Intelligence Artificielle (IA) se multiplient. L’émergence des acteurs cloud (principalement AWS, Azure et GCP) et des outils dédiés au développement et au déploiement de modèles de Machine Learning (ML) à démocratiser l’accès à l’IA.
Il devient, donc, de moins en moins nécessaire de construire des modèles de ML from scratch (de zéro). C’est à ce niveau là qu’interviennent les techniques de transfer-learning qui permettent de prendre des modèles ML déjà entraînés et de les ajuster, avec un cout en données et en puissance de calcul relativement faible, pour les use-cases cibles.
Le but de ce stage est de mettre en place un cadre de conception, développement, déploiement et maintien de modèles de machine learning basés sur des modèles pré-entraînés grâce au transfer-learning.
Vos missions
Le stage se déroulera comme suit, le tout étant testé et déployé en parallèle sur des use-cases réels afin de valider en continu l’applicabilité des concepts théoriques :

Identifier et cartographier les types de transfer learning
d’un point de vu méthode
d’un point de vu use-case
comparer aux autres méthodes similaires telles que le semi-supervised learning, incremental learning et active learning, voire auto-ml
Identifier les acteurs et les outils (open source ou non) principaux
comparer fonctionnellement, techniquement, et en termes de coûts
Identifier et formaliser les mesures génériques (extrinsèques) d'évaluation des modèles entraînés grâce au transfer-learning
Finaliser et déployer les use-cases

You have hands-on experience in defining and analyzing large, complex datasets, finding actionable business solutions to loosely defined revenue and operations problems.
You have proven stakeholder management expertise. As a collaborative thought partner, you're gifted at explaining your findings clearly to a non-technical audience.

You have deep expertise in designing and analyzing rigorous experiments of varying degrees of complexity. This includes mastery of at least one data visualization tool. We primarily use Looker.

You care about the details and understand that without high-quality instrumentation, we cannot drive high-quality, impactful insights.
You enjoy collaboration and knowledge sharing. You appreciate our team’s values of eagerness to collaborate with teammates with any level of statistical knowledge, iterating over your deliverables, and being curious.
You understand that perfect is the enemy of good. You will default to action by initially shipping solutions that simply work and work simply while iterating as needed.
Things You Might Do

Zapier is a fast-growing and remote-first company, so you'll get experience on many different projects to support our stakeholders. Here are some things you might get to help our teams with:

Drive proactive analysis/research into high-potential green fields.
Use a variety of statistical methods to explore, discover and present user and market insights in order to proactively guide a range of business decisions, such as how Zapier strategically positions itself in the automation market.
Ensure all teams have insight to data and can answer their own first-order questions.
Develop data literacy programs and provide easy-to-use tools with clear documentation, examples, and tutorials.
Perform basic ETL tasks to model new dimensions and facts in our data warehouse’s dimensional model. For the heavier lifts, you’ll be supported by Data Warehouse Engineering colleagues.
Tools you’ll probably use include AWS Redshift, SQL, Looker, Amplitude, DBT, Matillion ETL, and Python or R.

Yes? Okay, so far so good. Let’s jump to the next one: Would you like to be part of one of the best fintech companies coming out of Copenhagen, Denmark with ambitions to expand to new markets? If you can answer YES to this as well then we are off to a pretty good start. Let’s continue.
We are Risika. Data lovers, Culture geeks, Visionaries, Doers, Leaders, Gamers, Learners, Explores, Moms, Dads, Dog lovers, Strategists, Foodies but most importantly we are People-People and we genuinely believe that our people are the most important part of our company. Still with us? Great, then please keep reading.
We are looking for a Data Scientist based out of Copenhagen that has the experience and skills to take us to the next level, but buying into the above and having a “we” approach to your job is an absolute must. Perfect, you are on board with that as well. Let’s dive a bit deeper into the role.
As a Data Scientist in Risika, you will be working with large amounts of Financial and company data. You will get to work closely with the development of our Data Science Pipeline in a production level environment. This includes everything from the IT-infrastructure and scalability of our pipelines to feature and model-development!
We would like you to
Feel comfortable with taking ideas to action in the least possible time
Have a broad background with statistics and machine learning
Help us understand the data that we get and convert it into value
Expand and develop our machine learning models and pipelines in a production environment
Take responsibility of models deployed in production (including troubleshooting and maintenance)
Be comfortable with being on a scaleup journey where things can be a bit chaotic at times
Believe and enjoy that data preparation and preprocessing is just as important as creating the actual models
An understanding of financial statements and models - this is not a must but a great plus
What we would like you to have
Experience from a similar role and it would be amazing if you have a master’s degree in computer science, statistics, physics, mathematics or equivalent
Experience with processing and working with real-world data, and intuition with identifying and mitigating potential data and modelling bias.
Experience with neural networks and other machine learning techniques
Great programming skills in Python and SQL
Experience with production level code
A driven approach to your work and being okay with taking responsibility
An open minded approach to coaching and willingness to always learn new things
Excellent verbal and written communication skills in English and other languages are just a huge plus
You’ll probably have some other topics and ideas that we need to solve and that’s why the above bullets are what we imagine the main focus would be but we expect that you lay down the cards and help us understand what we need to focus on achieving our goals.
Currently, our Data Science department consists of three people. We have 8 models in production delivering automated risk-assessments or probability of distress in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and the United Kingdom.
What you can expect from us
Of course we offer all the lovely benefits like an awesome location in the heart of Copenhagen, flexible working hours, lunch and all of that good stuff. But the most important part is that we offer you the opportunity to join a one of a kind startup journey where you can create real impact (not just the buzz word kind of impact but real impact where you take full responsibility of your area of expertise) and work together with the friendliest and brightest minds in the industry.
About us
In 2017 a small group of FinTech nerds from Copenhagen hatched a vision to challenge the faceless and old-school status quo within the exotic industry of financial risk management. We leverage machine learning to help companies predict paying and non-paying customers, while delivering more ideal customers, through the Risika platform. Our ever growing collection of nerdy teamplayers has origins in auditing, sales, data and computer science, all gathered to make sure that our solutions are as flexible, automated, and reliable as possible. We are trusted by more than 1000 finance and sales professionals across the Nordics, and we are closing in on 100 champagne celebrations since we started - a ritual that manifests our triumph virtue."

We believe that starting a family is a basic fundamental right. However, for many people it is not that easy. Infertility is the most widespread chronic disease for people between 20-45. Unfortunately, the current fertility treatment model is broken. There has been little focus on patient experience, no holistic view on patients and the success rates for assisted reproductive technology (ART) are only between 20% and 30%.

 Fulltime
Bij Zonneplan komen een bijzondere combinatie van hardware en software bij elkaar. Door de afbouw van fossiele stroom en de groei van duurzame stroom komen vraag en aanbod steeds verder uit elkaar te liggen. Ondertussen stijgt het stroomverbruik razendsnel door de elektrisch vervoer en verwarming. Het gevolg is zowel een stijgende energieprijs als CO2-uitstoot en dat gaat in tegen onze missie van groene en betaalbare energie voor iedereen. Met Zonneplan zijn wij de uitdaging aangegaan en werken hardware engineers en softwareontwikkelaars samen aan de techniek die nodig is om energie groener, slimmer en betaalbaarder te maken.
Slimme energie en app

Een oud energiebedrijf verkoopt alleen kilowatts. Zonneplan niet. Wij zien energie als een samenwerking met onze klanten om samen maximaal gebruik te maken van groene stroom. Ons energiecontract is Slimme energie. Elk uur krijgen onze klanten een nieuwe prijs en trigger om te schuiven in verbruik. Het effect wordt gemeten door de Zonneplan Connect en is instant live in de app te volgen. Door focus op ultieme service en gebruiksgemak willen wij de snelst groeiende energieleverancier van Nederland worden.
Gridthis by Zonneplan

Voor automatische aansturing en monitoring heeft Zonneplan het Gridthis platform ontwikkeld. Gridthis Wave is een AWS hosted streaming-data dienst waar alle meetdata en andere informatie verwerkt en beheerd wordt. Alle apparaten worden ingedeeld in een virtuele infrastructuur waardoor apparaten onderling kunnen communiceren. Via gestandaardiseerde APIs kunnen regelbare devices wereldwijd op het platform worden aangesloten.
Gridthis Airnode

De Gridthis Airnode hebben wij ontwikkeld om elk apparaat regelbaar te maken. Het is een IoT device die je als dongle inplugt op laadpalen, batterijen, warmtepompen en omvormers. De Airnode is plug and play en werkt via 4G. Eind dit jaar zijn er 200.000 Airnodes online waardoor wij een van de grootste IoT netwerken van Europa beheren.
Zonneplan Charge laadpaal

In-house hebben wij de Zonneplan Charge laadpaal ontwikkeld, uiteraard aangestuurd via de Airnode. De Charge is puur als smart grid device ontworpen en gaat daardoor verder dan alleen je auto laden. De Charge is V2G ready, kan reageren op onbalans in het net en de klant kan via de app zelf alles monitoren, bedienen en inplannen.
Gridthis Quantum

Gridthis Quantum is ons Model Predictive Control center. Op basis van slimme meterdata, weerdata, energiehandel, energieprijzen, drukte op het net, consumentengedrag en wensen van de klant houdt Quantum het net in balans. Controlacties worden gedispatched naar Gridthis Wave. Data-, machine learning-, model ontwikkelaars en energiespecialisten werken samen met backend developers om Quantum verder te ontwikkelen.
Lead Data

Voor het doorontwikkelen van Quantum en Wave en het managen van data binnen Zonneplan zoeken wij een Lead Data die samen met ons wil werken aan de techniek voor een schonere toekomst.
Waar jij aan gaat werken
Je wordt lead van een of meerdere data teams;
Je gaat jouw team inspireren, begeleiden en coachen;
Je zet structuren, standaarden en richtlijnen op;
Je zorgt dat de juiste mensen op de juiste plek zitten;
Je zorgt dat data schaalbaar en onderhoudbaar blijft;
Je begeleidt integraties met andere bedrijven;
Je werkt met Python, Redis, Airflow en Docker en verschillende databases;
Je werkt aan Quantum, Wave en andere datasystemen binnen Zonneplan;
Je maakt APIs.
Vereisten
Je hebt minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in het ontwikkelen van datasystemen;
Je bent de beste data engineer of architect in je huidige team;
Je hebt een wo diploma;
Je bent naast denker ook een echte doener;
Je bent sterk in plannen en prioriteren;
Je neemt initiatief en komt met nieuwe frisse ideeën;
Je hebt veel ervaring met Git, Python en SQL;
Je hebt ervaring met AWS en Docker;
Je hebt ervaring met moderne CI/CD systemen;
Je hebt affiniteit met machine learning;
Je bent communicatief sterk (zowel in Nederlands als Engels).

Dat heb je ook zelf in de hand! Want als Data Scientist bij IVO Rechtspraak werk je in een datalab in oprichting. We maken als onderdeel van de Rechtspraak de Nederlandse rechtspraak digitaal toegankelijk. Met experimenten help jij rechters en andere medewerkers van de Rechtspraak meer datagedreven en dus beter te werken. Daarbij pas je de nieuwste technologieën toe. Spannend en ontzettend belangrijk!
Hoe je werk eruitziet
De Rechtspraak wil flinke stappen zetten in datagedreven werken. Vanuit het IVO Datalab krijg je alle ruimte om daar met experimenten aan bij te dragen. Je eigen team is jong en klein, maar je werkt nauw samen met data-analisten en data scientists van onder meer het datalab van het ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid en het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut. Genoeg sparringpartners en collega’s dus om nieuwe casussen en data-analyses op te pakken!
Bij het IVO Datalab kun je je creativiteit helemaal kwijt. Samen met collega-data scientists, juridisch medewerkers en rechters ontwikkel je allerlei analyseproducten. Dat gaat van een analyse op de datakwaliteit tot het inzetten van de nieuwste technieken voor natural language processing om relevante tekst uit een uitspraak te halen. En hoe geweldig is het om mee te werken aan een model dat alle uitspraken anonimiseert? Daarmee kunnen we ze online openbaar maken voor het publiek of wetenschappelijk onderzoek.
Aan de hand van experimenten inspireer je medewerkers van de Rechtspraak over de mogelijkheden van datagedreven werken. Zo vergroot je de datageletterdheid binnen de Rechtspraak. Dat betekent natuurlijk ook dat je goed duidelijk moet maken wat er kan en hoe dit helpt om beter te werken. Ook onderwerpen als privacy, ethiek en het operationaliseren van machine learning algoritmes staan op de agenda. Wat zijn bijvoorbeeld de randvoorwaarden om een AI-model in productie te nemen? En hoe houden we rekening met de menselijke maat bij de inzet van algoritmes? Jij denkt er allemaal over mee!
Hou je niet van een gespreid bedje, maar wel van uitdagingen, kansen en de ruimte om je ideeën in de praktijk te brengen? Dan is dit dé baan voor jou!
Wat we je bieden
Om te beginnen een leuke, informele werksfeer. We houden de lijnen graag kort! En je arbeidsvoorwaarden zijn prima geregeld volgens de CAO Rijk. Wat belangrijke punten op een rij:
Je salaris is maximaal € 5.139 op basis van 36-urige werkweek. Je zit in schaal 11.
Je krijgt een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB) van maximaal € 841 bruto per maand (16,37%). Dit is inclusief je vakantiegeld en eindejaarsuitkering. Je kunt dit budget bijvoorbeeld laten uitkeren of in vrije dagen omzetten.
Je houdt werk en privé prima in balans, bijvoorbeeld door thuis te werken, de mogelijkheid van 4×9 uur of ouderschapsverlof. Bovendien krijg je 144 vakantie- en 21,6 IKB-uren op basis van een 36-urige werkweek.
Binnen de IVO Academy krijg je alle ruimte en is er volop aandacht voor jouw persoonlijke én vaktechnische ontwikkeling.
Bij IVO Rechtspraak stimuleren we reizen met het OV! Je krijgt een OV-chipkaart waarmee je gratis voor je werk reist.
Je pensioen is goed geregeld via het ABP.
Je krijgt in eerste instantie een jaarcontract. Functioneer je goed, dan wordt dit een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.

Meer informatie over onze arbeidsvoorwaarden vind je op www.p-direkt.nl.

Wat we van je vragen
Dit zijn de dingen waar je volgens het ideaalplaatje aan voldoet:
Je hebt minimaal twee jaar relevante werkervaring als Data Scientist

Who we are? We are Big Data experts , working with international clients, creating and leading innovative projects related to the Big Data environment. We offer tailor-made solutions. It does not matter whether we are talking about building a Data Lake, conducting training in the field of data management, or performing detailed Big Data analysis. We don’t just focus on one technology, instead we specialize in a whole range of open-source and public cloud tools. Our team brings together over 130 specialists in their fields. We have participated in dozens of conferences, written countless amounts of code, we are the organizers of Big Data Tech Summit Warsaw, the largest Polish conference related to Big Data topics. We run webinars, share knowledge on blogs, creating whitepapers and more. Why? Because we believe that Big Data is an indispensable future of business.

MLOps enthusiasts
While the main goal of the GetInData and the team is creating value for clients using their data, we also do internal R&D work to grow our skills, create our solutions and practically verify others tools and approaches.

Example of projects

Ads personalization engine developed for a mobile app with over 250 million daily active users and 1 Billion daily ads impressions. The model predicted which ad category (e.g. healthcare, cars) a given user is interested in the most and gives such ads a higher chance to be displayed
In other project we are developing a Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model which will be translating 30 languages to English. The goal was to understand the context in which digital advertising inventory is sold. The technology stack includes AWS, dedicated neural net architectures and MLOps solutions for scaling and standardising the process
For a leading podcast-hosting app we are implementing personalised ads targeting models based on natural language understanding. We use AWS and IBM cloud services, as well as external data providers
User Suspension Model developed using Kedro and VertexAI. The model predicts whether the user is fraudulent and should not be granted access to the app. Multiple external data sources are used, such as social media data or user credibility based on a phone number
For a large Asian telecom, we developed time-series forecasting models. They are being used to predict hourly traffic volume for each of thousands of BTS in their network

Apart from commercial projects, we take part in internal initiatives, like:
Kaggle competition, where we develop a solution using Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, BigQuery, Looker) and our MLops stack (Kedro, MLflow)
Creating internal methodologies: Data Science projects methodology, Support for developing Data Driven cultures
Knowledge sharing sessions (Advanced Analytics Guild, Analytics Coffee etc.)

Responsibilities

Starting assumption is involvement in R&D initiatives utilising modern MLOps stack. The main goal is to deliver value on customer projects
Nurture your independence - take calculated risks, bring your ideas instead of just taking directions, take ownership of your growth- we promise to help :)
Be curious - look for opportunities to have fun with the problem you are solving - read, try approaches, learn from failure

LOOPME HAS OPENED IN POLAND! A full-time Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer position for an exceptional candidate who has a keen interest in multivariate modelling, machine learning and decision automation. You will be designing and building machine learning systems that will operate on real-world data making decisions in real-time. You will be working in the highly exciting area of real-time ad targeting.
This is a rare opportunity to be involved in creating an automated system to optimize hundreds of real-time interactions per second with online customers, and to quantify the benefits created against control groups in a live environment.
The work involves analysing billions of records of ad-serving opportunities, ad-serves and ad-server responses to understand what factors explain the variance in the expected response value. That understanding is then to be harnessed as an automated optimisation process capable of intelligently finding and servicing the most favourable ad-serving opportunities in a way that leads to higher returns on our clients’ advertising investments.
This is also an opportunity to become part of the UK tech start-up world and get first-hand experience into how tech start-ups operate.

Generation of graphical output
Preparation of data sets for predictive modelling
Robust predictive model building, validation and application
Automation of statistical processes
We are a small, highly interactive team working in an Agile environment where we prototype and then put into production machine learning solutions to solve real business problems. You will be involved with all stages of the development lifecycle from brainstorming ideas to the release of production quality code.
You will need strong communication skills. You will also be expected to care deeply about the quality of your code: its clarity, documentation, and testing.

Bonus Qualifications:
Practical experience of univariate and multivariate statistical analysis in R or Python with large data sets (millions of records and many tens or hundreds of independent variables)
Experience of Adtech
Experience in agile software development
Technologies: Elasticsearch, Clickhouse, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform
Experience with various messaging systems, such as Kafka
About you:
Strong self-motivation, reliable and flexible team-player
High attention to details, ability to remain focused under pressure
Proactive attitude towards improving processes and finding new solutions to challenging business problems
As Data Scientist, you will be able to combine your expertise in Mathematics, Statistics, and Coding in tackling complex data problems whilst being comfortable in a job requiring agility, curiosity, and continuous improvement. We are looking for someone who can very quickly grasp technical concepts and understand how to rapidly solve problems associated with them.

Description:

We are looking for an experienced technical manager with at least 4 years of experience in a management role as an extended leave cover for one of our Data Science groups.

The Candidates

We are looking for candidates with experience leading Data Scientists who come from a background in business, statistics, behavioral science, or related field, who apply their knowledge to product problems (experimentation, deep diving on data, relating data to insight and strategy, etc.). As this is a product analytics-oriented role, candidates from a heavy Machine Learning Engineering background won’t be considered.

Technical Skills Required

Data Science Managers are expected to be somewhat hands on, so to that end, we will be exploring some technical competencies as part of this recruiting process.

SQL (Very High Importance)

Candidates must be able to write SQL for data retrieval, manipulation, and summarization. They will need to deeply understand different types of joins, aggregate functions, and ordered analytical functions.

Candidates who show an inability to write SQL to the level required will not receive further consideration.

Product Work (High Importance)

The ideal candidate will have experience working in consumer-facing digital products that are backed by experimentation (AB testing). Some example companies strong in this type of product are King, Facebook, Booking.com, and logistics companies like Uber and Deliveroo (assuming the candidate worked on the customer-facing applications).

In the absence of this, candidates may also be considered if they have worked on problems that shape how humans use systems (e.g. PoS systems in grocery stores, food delivery companies, etc.). Some companies strong in this type of Data Science are Gousto, Ikea (particularly in their new distribution center teams they have been building in recent years), and logistics companies like Uber and Deliveroo (if the candidate worked on routing algorithms or the driver-facing applications).

If the candidate does not have direct experience working on these types of problems for these types of companies, they may still be considered if they are experts in the underlying science of experimentation (random sampling, common statistical tests, pitfalls in experimentation) and are familiar with agile product development, though the practical experience is certainly preferred over academic knowledge.

Candidates with none of these will not be considered.

Data Visualization (Moderate Importance)

We have a lot of custom libraries that produce consistent, easy-to-read charts for our more common tasks. However, it is still beneficial if a candidate has expertise in how to bring data visualizations to life in a way that makes it easy for her or his business partners to understand. We will not be assessing technical abilities in this area in the interview, but should the candidate choose to discuss it in her or his interviews with the Hiring Manager or Product Manager, it is certainly a plus.

Candidates without deep expertise in data visualization will still be considered.

Soft Skills Required

In addition to being self-sufficient on the technology front, candidates are expected to build and maintain relationships with partners in product, design, and engineering. We will assess these through:

– Communication abilities

– Showing examples of how the candidate’s work has had an impact

– Showing evidence of fitting in to the culture

It’s our job to ensure that they have a structural approach to data-driven problem-solving. Right now, there is only one question we try to solve in our three-way marketplace: how to make customers, drivers, and merchants happy and delighted. We have so far created millions of dollar impact across different journeys of customer - Search, Recommendations, improving discovery of merchants, predicting the food preparation time etc

 We work with the PMs hand-in-glove - be it constructing a new machine learning solution or brainstorming on a problem like how do we reduce the wait time for the drive, how do we improve assortment, should we treat convenience seeking customer differently from value seeking customer etc

 As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. Along with us coming from diverse backgrounds, we often have fun sessions to talk about everything and anything from data information to our current movie list. With WFH becoming more normalized, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone? ).

Have you ever wanted to build customer-facing products that rely extensively on data insights and models? Have you ever been keen on building a recommender model to customise your Grab app (or any other consumer app) experience? If you answered yes to either of these questions .. then look no further!
The Analytics team mission is to use data and experimentation to advance product innovation. We love building hacky products to test and iterate what’s best for our customers. As we ship multiple products every week, it means we have to fine-tune models, run and evaluate hundreds of experiments weekly! We are looking for junior and experienced data scientists to build a center of data excellence for Product & Experimentation in a diverse range of tech families. Your role is to guide a data-first approach to product thinking, design controlled experiments and be objective while evaluating results, all of this while working with stakeholders to evaluate new and innovative product and business ideas! You will help developers, designers & product managers across the company with recommendations on how to learn from unexpected results, study underlying causes for them and iterate on the next set of products to build for our users.
What Will You Do?
You will be working closely with various teams within a business line (Product, Business, Engineering, Design and Data Science) to understand data requirements, identify and track key metrics, and provide data-driven insights. You will also work with stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of new business/product ideas and provide appropriate recommendations.
A Day In The Life
Understand business objectives and deepdive into existing data to recommend new product ideas to solve for the most impactful customer problems (pssh .. some top-secret products await you!)
Use data to identify trends, spot anomalies and deepdive into their root causes
Use your number-crunching and slide-maker skills to use and present data beyond just numbers. Hone your data storytelling skills through visualisation techniques by building dashboards and presenting insights to a non-technical audience!
Evaluate the feasibility of developing new products, participate in user researches to validate customer problems
Align with stakeholders on key product metrics, design and propose experimentation strategies.
Launch A/B tests, analyze experiment results and provide recommendations
Design and own frontend and backend data specs for new products, while collaborating with engineering teams to ensure accurate and timely data collection
Develop and maintain data pipelines to fulfill product reporting requirements
The Must Haves
A curious and confident soul (with a dash of humour) who loves using data!
For Data Scientists, some relevant experience and for Senior Data Scientists, 2-3+ years relevant industry experience (preferably in an Internet or ‘Direct to Consumer’ company with high velocity data and scaled controlled experiments). Prior experience with Product Management will be a definite plus.
Strong statistical knowledge - ideally having utilized controlled experiments in the industry.
You enjoy using SQL, Google Sheets, R, SQL and other scripting/programming languages to solve customer-problems. Experience in Spark (Scala / pySpark) would be a plus.
Strong data visualization and storytelling skills. Experience in creating dashboards using Tableau and other visualisation tools.
Self-Starter: Ability to work independently and drive own projects.
Ability to deliver on tight timelines and move quickly with cross-functional teams to execute on decisions while maintaining attention to detail"
