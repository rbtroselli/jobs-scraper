 About BlocPower
 BlocPower is a clean energy startup leader creating Smarter, Healthier, Greener Buildings for All by reducing the barriers to money-saving, quality-of-life-improving green building retrofits. We provide engineering, financing, and project implementation services for clients in frontline communities across the country. These communities are underserved by traditional energy services companies because they are considered too small, too costly, or too risky. Our portfolio of projects include houses of worship, schools, non-profits, small businesses, and multifamily buildings. Through our work, we save our clients money, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve health, and create local employment opportunities.
 At BlocPower, we value our mission. We are trusted advisors that get things done for our customers by using data to make the right decisions. We support and expect excellence from our team members. We treat both our customers and ourselves with affection and respect.
