  Company Description
   The Mayor’s Office of Innovation is a new team working on Mayoral-directed strategic priorities, emphasizing data analysis, human-centered design thinking, cross-departmental coordination, and public-private partnerships to ensure outcomes-based policy making.
 The Innovation Team is focused on improving service delivery and city performance across the City through replicable, strategic projects in key policy areas like small business recovery, housing, and homelessness and mental health services.
 Priority initiatives include: a customer journey and data insight project to demonstrate how City dollars are funding better outcomes through our non-profit partners:;

 The City grants millions of dollars to non-profit organizations to address homelessness but has no way of demonstrating the outcomes of grants across all departments.
 The City funds services delivered by many non-profit organizations, but has no data set of all City-funded services.
 There is no reliable and up-to-date list of City-funded services that departments and non-profit organizations can use, making it hard for residents to be referred to services when they need help.

 We are looking for a curious and resourceful Data Engineer to show the power of data in bringing transparency and accountability to services, while keeping equity and ethical use of data at the forefront.  Appointment Type: Temporary Exempt (TEX), this position is excluded by the Charter from the competitive Civil Service examination process and shall serve at the discretion of the Appointing Officer.



  Job Description
   As the Innovation Team Data Engineer, you will be a part of the Mayor’s Innovation Team, and report to the Mayor’s Office. However, your position is based within Digital Services under DataSF, and will collaborate closely with the Chief Data Officer and the Chief Digital Services Officer.
 You will work directly with the Mayor’s policy staff and Department leadership, as well as community providers to identify existing data, gaps in reporting, and develop outcomes-based reporting structures.
 This position is funded, in part, through the Bloomberg Philanthropies Government Innovation Team, and will work in close partnership with the Bloomberg Center for Public Innovation at Johns Hopkins University.
 The Innovation Team will also include a Data Program Manager, a Service Designer, and a Project Manager. As a small and agile team, you will work together to deliver prototypes and solutions that will help address the city’s most pressing challenges.
 As the Data Engineer, you will be the technical lead on the program, working with stakeholders in departments to understand data sources and pipelines and building these out in a pragmatic way. You will advise the Mayor’s Office on the most feasible deliverables that are both technically possible, and high impact. You will be supported throughout by the rest of the Innovation team, the Chief Data Officer, and the Chief Digital Services Officer. You will:

 Work with departmental staff to develop extract, transform, load (ETL) requirements for individual datasets
 Consult with various departments on the best way to automate and publish datasets within their data ecosystems
 Apply an ethical lens to the appropriate use of data
 Create new analytics pipelines using ETL/ELT approaches according to standards and patterns you help develop and refine
 Serve as the technical lead for database exports, manipulation, and procedures used to create and update data incorporated into the data platform
 Implement analytics pipelines and/or data models to support analytics work
 Migrate existing ETLs to newer infrastructure to improve data quality and reliability as needed
 Standardize and improve existing pipelines to adhere to best practices
 As needed help iterate and refine best practices

 You will also identify ways in which data standardization, and data access, can contribute to the City’s commitment to equitable and ethical service delivery and analytics. In collaboration with departments, you will identify data gaps that hinder equity analysis.
 Removing barriers and making it easier for all people to access services or knowledge is a core part of any role with DataSF and the Innovation Team. Beyond any technical skill set or prior work history, accomplishing this ambitious task requires an empathetic understanding of the diverse array of experiences embodied in San Francisco. Your own life experience is a critical contribution to this effort. The Innovation Team is committed to building a team whose diversity reflects the residents we serve.

Welcome to the future of energy



 We are both an electricity retailer and a tech platform and we think there is no better way to address our greatest challenge, climate change, than with the combination of those two.
   


 Through our proprietary tech platform, Kraken, we are changing the way people interact with their energy company - by making it approachable, low cost, easy-to-understand, and most importantly, 100% renewable. We’ve distinguished ourselves by being named 2020’s Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service. In many markets we are a leading employer on Glassdoor for best places to work.
   


 At Octopus Energy, we’re developing a data platform that provides data services to all our retail energy businesses around the world. The platform enables self-service of data analytics to hundreds of data hungry users as well as automation of all our data workflows from simple ETL jobs to ML training and prediction. The data platform team works across the whole customer domain on anything from marketing campaign optimization to helping our traders buy the right amount of energy.
   


 Octopus Energy is growing fast and that means lots of data that needs to be ingested, organized, analyzed and shared with the team. We’re looking for a data engineer that can help us with this challenge. You’ll work across all different parts of the business to understand what our team’s needs and deliver data pipelines and tools to meet them. Because it’s still early days, you’ll need to be versatile and be equally comfortable building robust production ready pipelines or hacking together a quick script to run on your machine. You’ll spend most of your time engineering but you should also enjoy analyzing data and building data interfaces like Tableau dashboards or data applications.
   


 You’ll be part of our global data platform team who will provide dev ops and infrastructure support and technical guidance. We’re building a consistent data platform across all Octopus retail businesses in UK, US, Germany, Spain, Japan and NZ so you’ll be part of and contribute to a global data community.
   



What you'll do 

Work with the data scientists and data analysts to scope out and plan new data sources and pipelines Build, automate, deploy and maintain data pipelines Build Streamlet data apps and lend a hand building and maintaining Tableau dashboards Work with the global data platform team to deploy new tools and services into the US data environment Participate in and contribute to our global data community Build the infrastructure required for optimal extraction, transformation, and loading of data from a wide variety of data sources Use an analytical, data-driven approach to drive a deep understanding of fast changing business Build large-scale batch and real-time data pipelines with data processing frameworks in Amazon Web Services, Azure or GCP cloud platform





What you'll need 

First and foremost, we want our data engineers to be great software engineers with a passion for writing high quality code It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order): Python (in combination with Data Pipelines and Analytics) Advanced SQL knowledge and experience working with relational databases, query authoring (SQL) as well as working familiarity with a variety of databases. Experience modeling data for analytics - ideally experience using dbt as a modeling tool Experience building data pipelines in a cloud environment (ideally AWS) Spark The projects will be varied and we’re looking for someone who can work autonomously and proactively to scope problems and solve and deliver pragmatic solutions We want someone who is passionate about building great data tools for our business teams





Why else you'll love it here

 Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs. Unlimited paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need. 401(k) plan with employer match. Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible. Pre-tax commuter benefits. Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance. Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such. Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location. Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! When on a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!





If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you. 




At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership status, pregnancy and maternity status, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation.
