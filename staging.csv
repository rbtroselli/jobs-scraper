Salary: up to £45k depending on experience

Start date: ASAP

Location: Remote/Bristol. At the moment we are only able to accept candidates based in the UK.

Who are we?

Tumelo is a venture-backed, impact-led financial technology firm. We believe every investor should be empowered to use their shareholder voice to create change on issues like climate, gender and human rights at companies where their money is invested. Our mission is to build and scale the technology to make that possible.

We're a close-knit, fun and dynamic team. We champion autonomy and flexibility. We get stuck in and act strategically. We love food, rounders, board games... and having fun together, from canvas painting to cliff jumping in Devon!

We partner with the UK's largest investment and pension platforms; empowering them to provide their investors with transparency over the companies they own and a shareholder voice on issues they care about. Big change takes time but we are patient and ambitious in equal measure; influencing the system, building a movement, empowering the world.

The Role

This is an exceptional opportunity to get stuck in at a fast-paced, tech-focus, impact-driven start-up. As Data Engineer, you will be immersed in start-up life, collaborating closely with the product, technical and sales teams - managing the data that glues these teams and Tumelo's products together.

Work closely with Tumelo's Fund Manager Partnerships, Delivery and Customer Success teams to ensure relevant data is sourced, validated and made available on the platform to meet customer delivery project milestones.

Coordinate, validate and format data coming into Tumelo's platform so that all teams have accurate and timely data for the correct users/clients

Ensure data we are sharing with clients/users through our platform and APIs is top quality and up to date

Problem-solve to automate and streamline manual processes as they arise; think creatively about how to maximise data efficiency

Strategically address the scalability of data operations e.g. automation vs creating a team

Work with leading edge data processing technologies including Apache Airflow

 Desirable experience:

These are desirable rather than essential criteria. We welcome applications from people who do not have all the listed criteria but think they have what it takes and a willingness to learn by doing.

You will have experience in the extraction, transformation and loading of data from a variety of sources

Proficiency in the use of Python or similar programming language for processing and analysing data

You will be comfortable with the use of spreadsheets

We are trying to build a team that can conquer every challenge, speak every language, and understand every user. We have an ambitious mission to change the world so we hope to lead by example with a diverse and inclusive team that reflects the world we want to see. For the time being, you must have the right to work in the UK.

What we offer:

Up to £45k Salary, dependent on experience.

Generous company share scheme - we are all owners of Tumelo and beneficiaries of our collective success.

Flexible times with core communication hours of 10-3.

We're remote-first but we have an office in Bristol you are welcome to use.

We all commit to being in Bristol once per month to get together as a company and strategise, build on our culture and have some fun

5% employer pension contribution.

Flexible holiday policy of 33 days incl bank holidays.
