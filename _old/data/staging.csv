A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Pope's hat, the world's smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every day. The special object you’ve been searching for, or a new and unexpected interest you never thought you’d have: the more you look, the more you’ll find. And at Catawiki, there’s always more to the story. Every day sellers submit thousands of objects to sell on Catawiki. Our 240+ in-house experts review and select only the best to auction.

Our mission is to connect passionate enthusiasts with the objects that tell their stories. As Europe’s fastest growing online auction platform, we help over 10 million people discover new treasures every month. This means we are continually growing and always on the lookout for new talent!

Born and raised in The Netherlands, we started in 2008 and have since grown to over 750 Catawikians, working across 7 international offices, while maintaining our start-up mentality every step of the way. In December 2020 we received a new €150m investment round led by Permira and are excited to be growing our team and business further across the world.

Our Data Story

With thousands of active lots every day, hundreds of thousands of daily bids, millions of users, and billions of events, the Catawiki platform generates vast amounts of data every day. All this data is being collected and stored, and used extensively by our team of 10 analysts and data scientists to build insights and data products both for hundreds of internal users and real time applications on our website and apps.

As Catawiki grows and produces more data, we constantly have to scale and improve our data infrastructure to make sure we can keep using data to build a better company. We are therefore looking for a Data Engineer to help us tackle the challenge of bringing even more data sources into our platform and transforming and organizing this data for analysis and consumption by other applications. It’s a big challenge but one that we’re really excited about solving.

What you will do

You will work in cooperation with our Data Scientists and Software Engineers to:


Explore new ways of transforming and analyzing data and continuously expand and improve the performance of our data pipelines.
Bring in more data sources to our data platform by building robust and scalable data integrations
Work closely with Data Scientists and Product Managers to decide how best to structure and store data in order to make it easily accessible to business users.
Continue developing and streamlining our Kubernetes-based in-house data science platform to support the development and deployment of analyses and machine learning solutions

Who you are


A Data Engineer who likes to experiment with and explore new tools and technologies.
You have experience with Kubernetes on one of the major Cloud providers.
You’re comfortably working with multiple of the following technologies, as they’re all in our stack: Python, Java/Scala, Bigquery, PostgreSQL, Hive, Spark, Google Dataproc, Airflow, Kafka, Dataflow, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Vault
Professional experience with relational databases: reading, writing and optimizing complex statements.
You are interested in the (continuous) deployment of machine learning models
You know how to design and build low-maintenance, high performing ETL processes and data pipelines.
You can communicate an idea clearly on various levels of abstraction, depending on the audience.
You pro-actively identify potential areas of improvement, and are able to formulate a vision for the future direction of team-level components.

Where you'll be

This role is based in Amsterdam but we can offer remote work from the following countries: France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and The U.K. We also offer an excellent relocation package for people living outside of the Netherlands.

Here’s what we can offer you

This is your chance to become part of a fast but sustainable growing tech company! You will have an exciting role in a young, fast-growing, dynamic & international organisation. You'll be part of an enthusiastic, highly motivated team of 800+ international Catawikians; you'll have big responsibilities and can really create something. Additionally you can expect:


An attractive Stock Options package
Working with a top notch team acting on a champions league level in a super complex dynamic environment; you will learn a lot!
A diverse and international team with over 50 different nationalities.
A great office located in the heart of Amsterdam with an easy-going atmosphere.
Our entrepreneurial environment encourages everyone to take initiative and experiment with new ideas. You’ll actively contribute to the growth of the Catawiki platform.
Tailor-made trainings to facilitate your personal and professional growth
The fun part! Our Activity Committee plans everything from ‘CataFooty’ to International Food Festivals, Friday Drinks, Board Game Nights, Pub Quizzes and Boot Camps!

And there’s more! Paid holidays, holiday allowance and a fantastic pension plan paid for by Catawiki.

Diversity

Catawiki is committed to building a diverse company and diverse teams. That includes everyone, no matter your age, ability, gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. We welcome applications from underserved and underrepresented communities. If you’ve got a story to tell, come and join us.

Working and hiring remotely

When it is safe to do so, Catawiki will implement a hybrid work policy where employees in the Netherlands will work from the office 1-2 times per week and from home for the rest.

Most of our Sales and Expert positions for local markets are 100% remote, which means that you will be working from home in the country you are based.

  Company Description
   BlueOptima’s vision is to become the global reference for the optimisation of the performance of Software Engineers across all industries. We provide industry-leading objective metrics in software development. We enable large organisations to deliver better software, faster and at lower cost, with technology that pushes the limits of what has been done before.

 We promote an open minded environment and encourage our employees to create their own success story in this high performance environment.



  Job Description
   Job summary:
 BlueOptima has a truly unique collection of vast datasets relating to the changes that software developers make in source code when working in an enterprise software development environment.
 As a Machine Learning Data Engineer you will take problems and ideas from our clients and customer support teams, analyse what would be involved, whether the solution will solve the underlying problem, plan and develop solutions. Within time you should be able to provide your own pipeline of ideas or problems that we can tackle. As with many problems within the Data Engineering space, defining effective pipelines to gather, curate and manage the data is as important as selecting the best approach using ML techniques.
 You will take responsibility for the end to end process, this means that you will own the initial exploration of the data, the development of a solution, design the requirements for ongoing monitoring of the solution once it is released and tackle any issues that arise from the solution. Solution ownership is a fundamental part of the role and it is expected that you would not only take this for the solutions you develop but encourage others to own and take responsibility for the solutions they are involved in.
 You will use tools ranging from advanced Machine Learning algorithms to Statistical approaches and will be able to select the best tool for the job. This means both being able to suggest the cutting edge approaches to problems and just as importantly identifying when a simpler approach will provide a solution which is as effective. Finally, you will support and identify improvements to our existing algorithms and approaches.
 Your team:
 The Data Engineering team at BlueOptima accelerates value delivery for internal and external stakeholders by providing production ready solutions & actionable insights. We cater to all products within BlueOptima, supercharging their success through data driven innovation.
 You will be working hand-to-hand with a diverse team with a variety of skill sets across the fields of Data Analytics, Machine learning & Artificial intelligence. Majority of the team is currently based out of our Bangalore office.
 Responsibilities and tasks:

 Solve business problems using advance Machine Learning and statistical techniques
 Identify opportunities to add value and solve problems using Machine Learning across the business
 Identify bottleneck in skills, technology and processes restricting the team's ability to deliver excellence
 Exploring vast datasets, both structured and unstructured
 Owning the final solution; coordinating with different teams including engineering and client side teams to take a solution from exploratory analysis to deployed in production.
 Facilitate taking solutions into production, though active participation with the internal development teams
 Spec the requirements to solve a problem and identify the critical path and timelines and be able to give clear estimates quantifying any uncertainty
 Resolve issues and find improvements to existing Machine Learning solutions and measure their impacts
 Takes data-driven approaches to validate assumptions/issues and track progress on changes being implemented

 What You Need to Succeed at BlueOptima:

  Company Description
   BlueOptima’s vision is to become the global reference for the optimisation of the performance of Software Engineers across all industries. We provide industry-leading objective metrics in software development. We enable large organisations to deliver better software, faster and at lower cost, with technology that pushes the limits of what has been done before.
 We are a global company which has consistently doubled in headcount and revenue YoY, with no external investment. We currently are located in 4 countries: London (our HQ), Mexico, India and the US. A total number of 180+ employees (and increasing every day) from 22 different nationalities and with over 25 languages spoken.
 We promote an open minded environment and encourage our employees to create their own success story in this high performance environment.



  Job Description
   Location: Bangalore, India Department: Engineering
 Job summary:
 BlueOptima has a truly unique collection of vast datasets relating to the changes that software developers make in source code when working in an enterprise software development environment.
 As a Machine Learning Data Engineer you will take problems and ideas from our clients and customer support teams, analyse what would be involved, whether the solution will solve the underlying problem, plan and develop solutions. Within time you should be able to provide your own pipeline of ideas or problems that we can tackle. As with many problems within the Data Engineering space, defining effective pipelines to gather, curate and manage the data is as important as selecting the best approach using ML techniques.
 You will take responsibility for the end to end process, this means that you will own the initial exploration of the data, the development of a solution, design the requirements for ongoing monitoring of the solution once it is released and tackle any issues that arise from the solution. Solution ownership is a fundamental part of the role and it is expected that you would not only take this for the solutions you develop but encourage others to own and take responsibility for the solutions they are involved in.
 You will use tools ranging from advanced Machine Learning algorithms to Statistical approaches and will be able to select the best tool for the job. This means both being able to suggest the cutting edge approaches to problems and just as importantly identifying when a simpler approach will provide a solution which is as effective. Finally, you will support and identify improvements to our existing algorithms and approaches.
 Your team:
 The Data Engineering team at BlueOptima accelerates value delivery for internal and external stakeholders by providing production ready solutions & actionable insights. We cater to all products within BlueOptima, supercharging their success through data driven innovation.
 You will be working hand-to-hand with a diverse team with a variety of skill sets across the fields of Data Analytics, Machine learning & Artificial intelligence. Majority of the team is currently based out of our Bangalore office.



  Qualifications
   Responsibilities and tasks: 

Solve business problems using advance Machine Learning and statistical techniques
 Lead a team of Machine Learning Data Engineers providing technical leadership to mid/junior level team members
 Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders to understand requirements and opportunities to add value.
 Identify opportunities to add value and solve problems using Machine Learning across the business
 Identify bottleneck in skills, technology and processes restricting the team's ability to deliver excellence
 Exploring vast datasets, both structured and unstructured
 Owning the final solution; coordinating with different teams including engineering and client side teams to take a solution from exploratory analysis to deployed in production.
 Facilitate taking solutions into production, though active participation with the internal development teams
 Spec the requirements to solve a problem and identify the critical path and timelines and be able to give clear estimates quantifying any uncertainty
 Takes data-driven approaches to validate assumptions/issues and track progress on changes being implemented

 What You Need to Succeed at BlueOptima: 

Minimum Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Statistics/Mathematics or equivalent.

  Company Description
   As the industry leader in compensation management, Payscale is on a mission to help job seekers, employees and businesses get pay right, and make sustainable fair pay a reality. Empowering more than 53 percent of the Fortune 500 in 198 countries, Payscale provides a combination of data-driven insights, best-in-class services and innovative software to enable organizations such as Angel City Football Club, Perry Ellis International, United Healthcare, Vista and The Washington Post to make fair and appropriate pay decisions. Pay is powerful. To learn more, visit www.payscale.com



  Job Description
   What We Do: The Data Science Team focuses on building models that leverage Payscale’s five core compensation datasets to provide accurate, high coverage estimates of compensation ranges for jobs across industries and the globe. We use modeling techniques such as Bayesian linear regression, hierarchical modeling, transfer learning, NLP, and embeddings to model how different jobs are related to each other in order to produce good compensation range predictions. We do a mix of development on well-defined projects and greenfield innovation on our own ideas. We build internal tools (APIs and interactive demos (using e.g. streamlit)) to exhibit our work. We value teamwork, learning together, maintainability, documentation, and giving clear presentations about our work to non-ML stakeholders. We are generalist problem solvers—we use (or learn!) the best tool for the problem. Our team is remote with some team members working out of offices in Seattle, WA and Burlington, MA periodically.
 Our team works closely with compensation domain experts to help define the problems, identify and validate our assumptions, and evaluate our predictions. We are supported by a separate Data Engineering Team that helps turn our models into production APIs for use in products across Payscale’s portfolio.
 What You Do: You will be designing and building machine learning models that provide compensation estimates in low-data scenarios, allow us to quantitatively compare jobs to each other (embeddings, NLP), and quantify the impact that skills and other compensable factors have on pay across jobs, industries, and locations. You’ll interface with domain experts and software engineers on a regular basis. You’ll give periodic presentations about your models/findings to a technical, but not-ML-trained audience. Our codebase is in Python, with some Pytorch and Tensorflow.
 Day-in-the-Life:
 As a Data Scientist II, a typical day may include the following:

 Designing and building a new model
 Meeting with domain experts to get feedback on models
 Documenting findings, identifying promising avenues for model improvement
 Partnering with Data Engineering Team to drive productionization of models
 Participating in Data Science Book Club (bi-weekly open-invite learning workshop, currently focused on state-of-the-art NLP techniques)
 Mentoring Data Analysts on analysis and visualization techniques (e.g. stats, regression)
 Participating in team code reviews

 First Year in Role:
 By your third month, you’ll know how to access our datasets and code. You’ll be able to run the models that we are currently developing, and you’ll be contributing code to support these models—e.g. a new component for the evaluation suite, an internal head-to-head comparison of model results, or the application of one of our models to a particular domain.
 By your sixth month, you have completely ramped up on the team and you’ll own your own workstream: meeting with stakeholders, designing and scoping solutions, building, and presenting your findings and progress.



  Qualifications
  

 Quantitative graduate degree OR 3+ years building real-world machine learning models
 Fluency in Python – object-oriented programming, pandas, scikit learn
 Proficiency in basic SQL (joins, grouping, ordering, views)
 Experience using multiple supervised and unsupervised learning techniques with ability to compare approaches and results
 Exposure to 1 or more deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
 Able to clearly articulate technical concepts to developers, managers, and less technical colleagues
 Experience building interactive demos and prototypes is a plus
 Experience writing production-grade code for model training/retraining and inference is a huge plus

 Tools:

 We code everyday using Python (scikit learn, spaCy, Keras, Pytorch), and sometimes R, Scala, Julia.
 For accessing our data we use Snowflake and SQL Server
 For reporting and supporting Data Analysts, we use Tableau.
 We productionize with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Team City, and Octopus.

 Additional Information

About CalypsoAI:


AI-powered systems are increasingly being used to replace or augment human decision-making across a broad range of industries. These systems already impact many aspects of our lives and will continue to grow in their influence over the next two decades. Therefore, ensuring the reliability, safety, security, fairness, and understandability of these systems is critical. To date, tools to ensure that AI-powered systems meet these standards have lagged behind the tools used to develop them. This has led to two common outcomes: deployment of AI-powered systems without proper verification and validation, or conversely, failure to deploy a system after costly development time and resources due to a lack of trust in the system by stakeholders. This is where CalypsoAI comes in. We are building a suite of products and tools to facilitate the deployment of trustworthy AI by focusing on rigorous verification and validation testing.

  Company Description
   As the industry leader in compensation management, Payscale is on a mission to help job seekers, employees and businesses get pay right, and make sustainable fair pay a reality. Empowering more than 53 percent of the Fortune 500 in 198 countries, Payscale provides a combination of data-driven insights, best-in-class services and innovative software to enable organizations such as Angel City Football Club, Perry Ellis International, United Healthcare, Vista and The Washington Post to make fair and appropriate pay decisions. Pay is powerful. To learn more, visit www.payscale.com



  Job Description
   What We Do: The Data Science Team focuses on building models that leverage Payscale’s five core compensation datasets to provide accurate, high coverage estimates of compensation ranges for jobs across industries and the globe. We use modeling techniques such as Bayesian linear regression, hierarchical modeling, transfer learning, NLP, and embeddings to model how different jobs are related to each other in order to produce good compensation range predictions. We do a mix of development on well-defined projects and greenfield innovation on our own ideas. We build internal tools (APIs and interactive demos (using e.g. streamlit)) to exhibit our work. We value teamwork, learning together, maintainability, documentation, and giving clear presentations about our work to non-ML stakeholders. We are generalist problem solvers—we use (or learn!) the best tool for the problem. Our team is remote with some team members working out of offices in Seattle, WA and Burlington, MA periodically.
 Our team works closely with compensation domain experts to help define the problems, identify and validate our assumptions, and evaluate our predictions. We are supported by a separate Data Engineering Team that helps turn our models into production APIs for use in products across Payscale’s portfolio.
 What You Do: You will be designing and building machine learning models that provide compensation estimates in low-data scenarios, allow us to quantitatively compare jobs to each other (embeddings, NLP), and quantify the impact that skills and other compensable factors have on pay across jobs, industries, and locations. You’ll interface with domain experts and software engineers on a regular basis. You’ll give periodic presentations about your models/findings to a technical, but not-ML-trained audience. Our codebase is in Python, with some Pytorch and Tensorflow.
 Day-in-the-Life:
 As a Data Scientist II, a typical day may include the following:

 Designing and building a new model
 Meeting with domain experts to get feedback on models
 Documenting findings, identifying promising avenues for model improvement
 Partnering with Data Engineering Team to drive productionization of models
 Participating in Data Science Book Club (bi-weekly open-invite learning workshop, currently focused on state-of-the-art NLP techniques)
 Mentoring Data Analysts on analysis and visualization techniques (e.g. stats, regression)
 Participating in team code reviews

 First Year in Role:
 By your third month, you’ll know how to access our datasets and code. You’ll be able to run the models that we are currently developing, and you’ll be contributing code to support these models—e.g. a new component for the evaluation suite, an internal head-to-head comparison of model results, or the application of one of our models to a particular domain.
 By your sixth month, you have completely ramped up on the team and you’ll own your own workstream: meeting with stakeholders, designing and scoping solutions, building, and presenting your findings and progress.



  Qualifications
  

 Quantitative graduate degree OR 3+ years building real-world machine learning models
 Fluency in Python – object-oriented programming, pandas, scikit learn
 Proficiency in basic SQL (joins, grouping, ordering, views)
 Experience using multiple supervised and unsupervised learning techniques with ability to compare approaches and results
 Exposure to 1 or more deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
 Able to clearly articulate technical concepts to developers, managers, and less technical colleagues
 Experience building interactive demos and prototypes is a plus
 Experience writing production-grade code for model training/retraining and inference is a huge plus

 Tools:

 We code everyday using Python (scikit learn, spaCy, Keras, Pytorch), and sometimes R, Scala, Julia.
 For accessing our data we use Snowflake and SQL Server
 For reporting and supporting Data Analysts, we use Tableau.
 We productionize with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Team City, and Octopus.

 Additional Information
   In the spirit of pay transparency, we’re excited to share the target annual salary for this position is $145,455 as well as eligibility for a 10% company performance bonus.

  Company Description
   At Koneksa, we are focused on technology innovation – developing digital biomarkers and novel endpoints to improve clinical research and drug development. We help drug development organizations and research hospitals collecting data using wearable devices and other digital tools. We develop endpoints based on wearable and outcome data to support deployment of various digital measures, including but not limited to actigraphy devices, biopotentials, device-based functional assessments, and electronic questionnaires.
 Koneksa’s software platform is used to integrate, manage and analyze certain types of ‘real world’ data that are gathered from patients who participate in clinical studies. This includes data that can be reported by patients using a mobile device such as iphone, apple watch or gathered from other types of medical devices that can be used remotely to collect important data such as activity, sleep, lung function or vital signs.



  Job Description
   Digitally supported clinical measurement concepts rely heavily on combining evidence from the literature, data models, retrospective analyses with clinical expertise. Many such concepts combine multiple measures, devices and datasets which may be combined to create multiple distinct or a single composite endpoint.
 This role reports to the Head of Data Science and provides “3rd line” support in their partnerships with the CMO, commercial and execution teams to research and develop data driven aspects of such measurement concepts - from inception through to handover for study execution. The role is hands-on applied and clinically informed data science - think of the role as a continuous Ph.D..
 The work product of the role requires delivery to the standards required by the regulated environment in which we operate, peer reviewed publications and commercial contract. On any given day, you may be researching peer reviewed literature, writing analysis plans, code or papers and giving presentations to internal or external stakeholders. Each problem you work on will be new territory - no search engine will tell you possible answers - only you and the combination of your curiosity and fundamental science can do this.
 Aside from scientific and technical competencies, the role will require attention to detail, initiative, and eagerness - which together drive a willingness to find solutions instead of problems. You are a lateral thinker able to read and rapidly comprehend scientific literature, connect diverse dots and move forward. Everything you do will require constant quality communication to different stakeholders with differing levels of expertise.
 Responsibilities

 Develop evidence-based and data-driven solutions to clinical measurement problems
 Architect and deliver concept data models supported by evidence from the literature
 Create evidenced based simulations to describe pertinent scenarios
 Define and execute retrospective analyses in partnership with the biostatistics team
 Develop solutions which can be delivered within regulatory validation frameworks
 Analyze any relevant data, persistently aware of contextual limitations
 Effectively and proactively communicate and collaborate with external and internal teams to gather information and contribute to data transfer specification contracts
 Create presentations for different types of stakeholders
 Contribute to patents, peer reviewed publications, grant proposals, clinical protocols/synopsis and regulatory submissions in partnership with other team members
 Clinical study protocol/synopsis development with minimal guidance; including writing, reviewing, resolution of cross functional comments while ensuring high clinical quality




  Qualifications
  
 Be hands on and delivery oriented in everything you do - talking is one aspect of doing
 PhD with 3+ years of work experience in commercial and clinical data science or publication equivalent record
 3+ years of clinical domain / clinical research experience including protocol development and execution, preferably in regulated industries from data science perspective
 Advanced statistical analysis techniques
 Excellent communication, critical thinking and problem solving skills

Commitment & Contract
Full time or part-time. Permanent or fixed-term (depending on seniority).
Location
Milan, Italy or fully remote. If you choose the on-site option, it’s also fine to sometimes work remotely. We offer substantial support for relocation, including finding an apartment in Milan and paying the rent for 12 weeks.
Description
We go all-out to create wonderful mobile apps and have them reach as many people as possible. As a company of rational thinkers with big visions, our decisions rest on robust foundations of truth—from the smallest feature choices to the most consequential strategic decisions. That’s why we’re looking for a sharp, business-driven data scientist who’s obsessed with finding (often counterintuitive) answers to complex, crucial questions.
A few examples of your responsibilities:

Using both standard and out-of-the-box techniques, analyze massive sets of usage data to identify opportunities and actionable insights that can profoundly impact our strategy.
Apply statistical and mathematical knowledge to develop new predictive or explanatory models that will help us gain business insights and define our roadmap.
Communicate new findings, document tools and methodologies, and relay best practices to all relevant stakeholders.
Help direct the development of our technologies devoted to the acquisition, storage, and manipulation of big data, supporting our efforts to constantly break new ground in this field. Contribute to the design and the implementation of our data pipelines.
Study scientific literature and available tools, stay up to date on new technologies, and identify relevant innovations.

What We Offer

Huge impact. Your analysis will help support and steer Bending Spoons. That means it will impact tens of millions of users, and even the mobile app industry at large, in the next few years.
No micromanaging. Be the owner of your effort—from day one, you’ll be one of the team and fully trusted to take responsibility for your tasks.
Lots. Of. Data. With tens of millions of users, hundreds of thousands of new users every day, and a large, diverse, and ever-growing portfolio of products, Bending Spoons is the perfect playground for a data nerd (we know you are—we are too!).
Top-notch team. You’ll be surrounded by some of the brightest and nicest folks you’ve ever worked with, and you can tap into a wealth of experience when it comes to building market-leading mobile apps.
Unique career opportunity. By joining a fast-growing company that’s already a leading global player within the vast, booming mobile market, you get a golden chance to turbocharge your learning and career.
Continuous education. Spooners get unlimited backing for learning investments, including Italian or English lessons and things like courses, conferences, and books. There’s no permission or approval process—you’re fully trusted to use the company’s resources efficiently.
The finest tools. You get the best hardware on the market and all the software you could need. We can't wait to introduce you to our high-tech approach and cutting-edge workflows.
Remote working. Spend as much or as little time in our Milan office as you choose. Many Spooners like to change up their environment and get out of the city whenever the mood strikes. You’ve always got the freedom to decide where today’s office is.
Flexible schedule. Our regular hours are 9-6 GMT+1, but this isn’t a “clock in, clock out” company. You’re fully trusted to create the right conditions for your own personal peak productivity. We only ask that you’re available to your teammates a good chunk of the day. That’s why it’s generally best to be based somewhere with a similar time zone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.
Unlimited vacations. Take all the time you need to recharge your batteries—no permission process or vacation allowance here. Because a rested, relaxed, and refreshed Spooner is a happy and effective Spooner.
Stimulating environment, tons of fun. Our incredible People Operations team organizes awesome events, such as team games, drinks, yoga classes, parties, and regular company-wide retreats. Recent destinations include Bali, Mauritius, and Tanzania.
Top-of-the-market salary and stock options in a tech rocket ship. Our total compensation is very competitive and can grow rapidly and include stock options, depending on your performance.

What We Look For

Rock-solid analytical reasoning. You crunch numbers and perform calculations with confidence and accuracy. You interpret graphs at a glance and discern signals from noise. You learn quickly, you investigate and solve unforeseen challenges with creativity and structure, and you can do so independently.
Strong quantitative skills. You have a strong passion for math and statistics, as well as solid fundamentals in both fields. It’s a strong plus if you studied Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, or Economics at MSc level.
An inquisitive nature. You feel the urge to understand why things are the way they are, and you’re curious enough to question unproven beliefs and assumptions. Finding the truth and explaining it is your crusade.
Pragmatism and sound judgment. You’re pragmatic enough to recognize the importance of doing it once, and doing it right. You have unfailing common sense, and a business-oriented approach when it comes to understanding what’s likely to create value.
Creativity and imagination. You like to think outside of the box and challenge previous assumptions to find the best solutions—however counterintuitive they may be.
Some programming knowledge. Ideally, you can run SQL queries, and code in Python or some other high-level language. But don’t worry, we’ll teach you everything you don’t know.
Drive. You’re energetic, hard-working, and persevere through adversity until the job is done, and done impeccably.
Good communication skills. You can pose questions with clarity, explain your reasoning concisely, pick the right graph to express a message, and create brief, insightful reports with a touch of artistry.
Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to constructive criticism, and ready to get your hands dirty with whatever the team needs to succeed.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

The Recruiting Process
If you successfully pass through our screening process, we’ll invite you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach and solve unfamiliar problems. These tests don’t require any prior knowledge, and they should take a few hours to complete. If you’re successful there, we’ll invite you to take part in some interviews—normally two or three—to get to know each other and figure out if it’s a good fit for both parties. The interviews are held remotely, and include some behavioral and problem-solving questions. To limit human bias, all of our hiring decisions are made by a hiring committee rather than any individual.
Spooners come from all over the world and English is our working language. We welcome applications in English or Italian—whichever suits you best! All interviews and assessments take place in English and are held online.
Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment all applicants, regardless of their race, religion, color, ancestry, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, pregnancy, political affiliation, disability, and any other legally protected characteristic. We’re committed to providing reasonable accommodations for candidates with disabilities in our recruiting process.

Medical evidence provides overwhelming and empirical evidence that vaccination is currently the most effective means of preventing the spread of COVID-19 and reducing the likelihood of serious illness, death, transmissions and infections. More information about our mandatory vaccination policy will be discussed during the recruitment process for this position.
